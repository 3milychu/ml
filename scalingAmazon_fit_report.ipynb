When I saw this mix, I thought, right on! They've done it for me!  Unfortunately, they use mini chocolate chips (which pretty much blend into the surrounding cake) and not enough of them, so it doesn't quite add up to the Chocolate Lover's Dream Snack/Dessert.  We don't frost them, however; maybe that's the extra needed \"push\" to make it a 5 star rating.  Frosting costs more than the cake mix, however, so I try to stay away from it.

What the cookie and candy industry refers to as the fun size.  That might explain some of the negative comments as to these Oreos being rather cheap with the filling.  In my opinion the ratio is the same, they are just smaller.<br /><br />This 12 pack is an excellent buy on Amazon.  Buy two of them and you get free shipping and for the majority of us, no sales tax.  A fine buy if you have a lots of Oreo fiends in your home that prefer a measured amount of these great cookies.

First, put one scoop in your glass. Then, add just enough of your liquid, I suggest OJ, to cover the powder in the glass. Then, with a knife, stir the mixture so it makes somewhat of a \"wasabi/soy\" consistency. You want a pasty texture and make sure to mix around the edge of the glass with the knife. Then, pour the rest of your desired amount of liquid on top and mix once more. It ends of perfectly mixed with no clumps. I also want to add that I am a breastfeeding mom.

They are so good that, even knowing the design flaw, I keep buying them and replacement probes.<br /><br />The receivers and transmitters all work well and seem to have an expected long lifetime.  The probe is the Achilles heel in every make and model of wireless thermometer.  Within the metal, flexible shielded cable that runs from the probe to the transmitter are small wires.  Small weak wires.  Small fragile wires.  Small worthless wires due to their failure rate.<br /><br />If the user closes the lid of the BBQ or smoker on the metal shielded cable between the probe and the transmitter, the internal wires WILL fail.  It may take 2 or 3 times, but they will fail.  If the metal shielded cable is kinked or bent too sharply, the internal wires will fail.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I was on the Webber customer service line (again) requesting a new probe because the wires failed.  I asked the customer service representative if she owned one of these wireless systems and, to my surprise, she said \"Are you kidding?  I would NEVER own one of these\".  I asked her why and she said \"I have a full time job, 7 days a week taking calls just like this one -  people complaining 8 hours a day, 7 days a week because the probe failed\".<br /><br />Now, if I were her boss, I would have fired her on the spot.  From a consumer's point of view I found this conversation somewhat alarming.<br /><br />This summer I will probably buy another and attempt to keep the smoker's lid from crushing the tiny worthless wires - but eventually I will fail and so will the probe.<br /><br />In short, this is a great product with a major and easily correctable design flaw.  Be prepared that the wires within the shielded cable can and will fail.\n",

These coffees are a great combination of flavor and a medium bodied coffee. I have tried five of their flavors and all of them taste exactly like what they are supposed to taste like. The 5 I have tried are the raspberry truffle of course and Creme Caramel (tastes like those little square caramels you see at Halloween), Spicy Mayan ( My favorite chocolate and cinnamon mix), pecan praline and creme brulee. I am so happy I no longer have to spend more to stock these coffees. My house is never out of the Raspberry Chocolate truffle and the Spicy Mayan. They have the best and most unique flavors. If you like flavored coffee that is full of flavor and yet has a nice smooth medium bodied coffee taste, then these are a must try. I highly recommend the Van Houtte line of k cups.\n",

The CANDY MAFIA. I sent an email to CANDY MAFIA to make sure I was not dreaming. They sent an email back,saying it was the real thing. I ordered 2 bags. When I got the tootsie roll pops, the first thing I did was to eat one. It was the real thing. I still order them and eat them. I think eating too many of them. THANK YOU CANDY MAFIA.\n",

It's continuous shock will prevent animals that bite it from being able to let go and will cook them from the inside. It's killed two of our animals. We weren't 100% sure after we found the first one dead, but the second one was obvious.<br /><br />The company's website claims that none of their chargers will harm *any* animal so we called them up and let them know they kill. As it turns out, they already knew that their continuous chargers kill small animals so they sent us an intermittent one for free. (Doesn't really make up for the $400 worth of animals their product has killed and the fact that one was a pet.) They haven't changed their website even though it's a lie. I noticed that they also sell chargers specifically for birds that are continuous and run at the same power output as the chargers for larger animals. One has to wonder why they sell a product that they know will kill the very animals it's supposed to be protecting. Avoid this company.\n",

It will not be available until they get their act together.<br /><br />Second, I have tried many instant, non-fat powdered milk brands and this is still my favorite.  I bought the Saco brand at Christmas, and while it was good, it is a bit different than the Carnation brand.<br /><br />Third, I don't think it's over-priced.  Dairy has risen and will continue to rise because they are using corn for fuel instead of feeding it to the cows.  I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and I don't believe I have ever seen a box this big even offered in any of the stores I frequent.  This size combined with free shipping--I think it's a great bargain.<br /><br />If you keep it in your freezer and take it out as you need it, it will have a better flavor than leaving it on the shelf.  This goes for all powdered milks.  I even keep my homemade hot chocolate mix in the freezer for the same reason.<br /><br />I hope it becomes available soon!  Amazon, thanks for offering it for sale!\n",

      "Text:  My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!\n",
