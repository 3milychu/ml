### Very entertaining!
These dinos are great for powerful chewers! Our dogs just LOVE them.  Our dogs have also worked the head, legs, and tail off, but still are actively grinding away at them.  They last quite a long time too, which is a major bonus.  I highly recommend these to anyone with dogs who love to chew!

I like this stuff because it doesn't taste awful and it has the equivalent effect on my body that fiber powder would have on most people. I do feel more calm and sleepy however I Can't sleep when I take it. So if I take it in the am I'm tired but if I take it in pm I can't sleep. I also get cramps because its doing something to my digestive system.

### Like eating fresh coconut...
These Oskri coconut bars are like eating a fresh coconut.  Very slight fruit addition such as pineapple, mango, etc.  HI energy and no added refined sugars.  Been enjoying them for several years.  this is a bargain as they usually sell at the store of over a dollar each.  And with prime membership the shipping was FAST and covered at no additional cost.  ENJOY!!!! We sure do!

### not what I'd hoped
It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had "melted" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution.

### Great product - really works
My cat was eating the regular Natural Balance Ultra Premium formula until I realized there was a reduced calorie formula. She was overweight at the time, and she lost a pound after eating this food regularly for about 2.5 months. She was then switched to a half dry/half wet diet to increase her hydration, and she now also eats this same formula but in the wet food. She wakes me up every morning for her dry breakfast before my alarm goes off. She loves this stuff, and it makes her coat soft and shiny on top of her weight loss! I would definitely recommend this product to others. (The only downside I've noticed is that the small kibbles are small enough that she just swallows them whole most of the time, and if they were bigger, they'd help clean her teeth as she bites them--then I wouldn't have to brush her teeth!)

### 1 Pouch = 2 Servings.....Kids Love Them!!!!
The very first time my grandkids, ages 16 months & 2 1/2 yrs., tried Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Juicy Pear & Garden Greens Pouches, they asked for seconds. At that time, I didn't realize that one pouch is actually 2 servings. They each had 4 servings that day! A couple days later my grandson wanted another helping of spinach tortellini but I decided to give him one of these pouches instead. He looked at me with a huge smile & said, "I love these things!"<br /><br />Curiosity got the best of me so I sampled the puree. It's not watery & holds its shape on a spoon.<br />Surprisingly, I could taste the broccoli/greens & the pears.<br /><br />These are not only great for meals, but can be used as a take-along snack.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid, organic lemon juice concentrate<br /><br />no artificial ingredients, no added sugar, no thickeners/fillers, no added salt, gluten free, kosher; USDA, FDA, and organic certification<br /><br />Edited to add that 4 servings a day caused the 16 month old to have messy blowouts in her diaper.  I think most Mom's will know what I'm talking about. This was discovered because both kids love these so much that we gave them a pouch for snacktime too. 4 servings a day of the Juicy Pear & Garden Greens proved to be too much for the 16 month old, but the 2 1/2 year old didn't have any problems.<br /><br />5 stars

### My favorite brand
I suspect most people do not use Rose Water often, but I use it at least once a week and have learned to appreciate the product quality of Al Wadi.<br /><br />Rose Water is a potent way to add a flavor many westerners are not familiar with.  You can fry many pastries, or add it to filo dough products, and enjoy something that just tastes right.<br /><br />It's essential to zulbia and it's a great enhancement to elephant ears (not literally ears... this is a crunchy Persian ear-shaped dessert called gosheefeel).  But I also wind up adding this to french toast and pancake batter when I want a change of pace.  I also have experimented with this in barbeque sauce, and it's not for everyone, but I think it's pretty tasty.<br /><br />It can overpower if you're not sparing, but if you've never tried it, this is a great item to pick up and experiment with.

### Tasty little treats but not organic
If these little cookies were organic they would get 5 stars plus, but alas they are not.  They are extra sweet with only 60 calories per bar, mostly from concentrated fruit juices.  They do have a definite raspberry taste and I'm a sucker for "anything raspberry"!<br /><br />We are not gluten sensitive but do not eat wheat. I bought them because they contain no wheat or refined sugar and the price on Amazon is very good.  I just wish Barbara's bakery would change to organic ingredients because they make such tasty treats.<br /><br />All that said, two bars and a nice big glass of soy or almond milk make for a satisfied evening tummy! (They're good with coffee or tea too.)

### Big hit with my daughter
My daughter loves these!  I used to be so super worried about her choking on anything; I even used to cut those Gerber star puffs in half.  Then one day she just chewed it up.  So I then tried the Gerber crunchies and she loves those too.  The cheese are her favorite, but she doesn't like the cinnamon maple ones.  Then I tried the Gerber Wheels and she loves them.  She holds them with one hand and then bits a piece off and chews it.  They are harder than the rest of the snacks but they still dissolve.  She did stick the whole thing in her mouth one time and I told her no, and out it came.  She hasn't stuck the whole thing back in her mouth since.  I would defiantly recommend these, just watch your child while she is eating them.

### Tastes like coffee; not Cappuccino but tastes smooth
What is surprising to me about this drink is that it says "Do Not Shake" on the can. The color is dark brown.  It taste like a good cup of coffee, smooth and not bitter or acidic. However,  to me it is not creamy like Cappuccino.  I would have rated this 4 stars for the taste but because I do not consider this a Cappuccino I lowered this to three stars.  Each 8.45 ounce serving is 100 calories with 15 calories from fat.  The first four ingredients are coffee, low fat milk, sugar, and cocoa powder.<br /><br />Now my boyfriend really liked this drink (he shared it with me) and said it tasted very creamy to him.  He likes caffeine so at 81 mg it's about half the mg in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).  He felt this tastes better than Starbucks drinks.  However, at the current price of about $1.80 per can he thought it was too expensive and would rate this 4 stars only because of the price.  If the price were $1.25 per can,  he would buy this and have rated it 5 stars.

### Okay kona coffee
I saw the beans on sale at Busch's and grabbed it.  It was a little different than what i had expected since I've been having Millstone Kona Blend up to this point.  Compared to the Millstone, the color of this coffee looks darker and it tastes slightly more bitter as well.  I did not detect a strong fresh coffee aroma once it's brewed. But it does inherit the characteristic mellow and smooth feeling of Kona beans. Btw, I brew with a Biatelli stovetop espresso maker which makes just about 1 mug of coffee.  Overall, i think it's an okay coffee, probably not the best, but not the worst either, just feels a little plain in terms of kona beans. The bean itself has an oily shine to it and smells good. I remember the Millstone beans had no shine but it was light roasted while this one is medium-dark roast.  I think I would go back to Millstone or try something else with more Kona.

### healthy and delicious =)
Vita Coco Coconut Water has become a vital part of my day. A few months ago, I read that Vita Coco has 15 times more electrolytes than any sports drink on the market. However, I do not consider this drink just a sports drink. For example I have swapped my morning coffee with a 100% pure Vita Coco. Unlike drinking coffee and than crashing, Vita Coco makes me feel energized throughout the day! Whenever I make breakfast smoothies, I always use Vita Coco. Below is a great recipe to try!<br /><br />3 cups frozen strawberries<br />1 banana (or 1 cup of blueberries)<br />1 cup Vita Coco (I use 100% pure)<br />1 cup of icecubes (optional)<br /><br />Place all ingredients in a blender and puree well. Add more Vita Coco if needed for smoothier consistency. Too easy, too good!<br /><br />I swear by this drink. I used to get cramping in my muscles and shin splints after running...but when I drink this before and after my run, I do not feel any pain....<br /><br />Simply put when I drink Vita Coco, I feel more refreshed and healthier. So thanks for making such a great product!

### Absolutely delicious!
Wow!  Who knew you could get this kind of quality from a sauce in a jar??  This stuff works with just about anything:  I've used it with shrimp, chicken, homemade meatballs, artichokes and mushrooms -- the flavor just blends beautifully.  If you've never had "vodka sauce" before, it's sort of like a creamy marinara sauce with a splash of vodka (but you won't taste any alcohol -- it all burns off).  This has chunks of tomato in it for some texture, too.  I liked it so much I've set up a subscription, and will definitely be trying more of the Scarpetto line of sauces.<br /><br />Preparation couldn't be simpler: just eat in the microwave right in the jar (loosen the lid first, of course); or you can heat it in a small saucepan on the stove.  Piece of cake.  Serve over the cooked pasta of your choice, or use it in a casserole with layers of cooked pasta and some chicken or Italian sausage.  Top with cheese, and you've got a meal.

I do agree with other reviewers that it needs to be thawed and softened for it to really be done justice; I first tasted it fully frozen and didn't think the flavor or consistency were great.  About 20 seconds in the microwave, and it was rich and almost like a cold pudding--so wonderful!

### Great taste gourmet treat on a budget!
First off if you are looking for one of the super dark 70%+ chocolateThe bars this is NOT for you.  The chocolate is dark, however not bitter at all and has a slightly sweet taste.  The dark, rich, full chocolate flavor is apparent and is complimented well by the creamy texture and smooth taste in the mouth.<br /><br />The dark chocolate bars are made in the USA in Novato, CA.  Torn Ranch is a company that supplys high end treats mainly in the hospitality market.  Might be difficult to find unless you fly first class or stay at a 5 star hotel.  You can direct order online at tornranch.com.  Though if you do these are going to set you back $3 each plus taxand shipping with a 6 bar minimum.  Amazon was 31 for 24 and no tax plus Prime as a shipping option.  A GREAT deal.<br /><br />Package was interesting.  The 24 came in a large, ugly, cardboard box that had been directly sent by itself to amazon,  Basically 24 loose bars in a Torn Ranch shipping box.  So if you are looking at giving this whole as a gift the package will be lacking.  They are individually packaged with each bar having a sealed plastic inner sleeve that is surrounded by a nice printed light cardboard outer box.  The chocolate is sectinal - unlike the other review these are now three piece to a bar.<br /><br />Very, very tastey treat that I will reorder once these 24 are gone.  However, would not reccomend youy buy this as a gift to send (all 24 at once anyway) as the packaging for ther 24 is pretty rough and not eye pleasing.

Macaroni and Cheese Purists will NOT like this product.  Let's get this straight--this is macaroni (organic semolina, specifically), it is cheese (organic cheddar cheese made with organic cultured milk, enzymes, salt), but it is also TOMATO!(tomato puree made with organic tomato paste).<br /><br />I can only recommend the organicity and quality of this product; the flavor experience is an individual one. However, if you like tomato mixed with your macaroni and cheese, they've done a good job of blending the flavors into a natural and good tasting product.

I tried the BBQ first and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I have always had a weakness for Sour Cream & Onion so figured it would be heaven in the popchips calorie sized bags..<br /><br />And it arrived and just didn't have the same 'tang' as most SC&O flavors do.

### This smoked paprika is supurb!
If you want a super smoked paprika, this is the one!  Far better than regular "paprika" you find in the grocery store or even the "Spanish paprika" you find in some of the better stores, but if you like a smooth, smoky, mild flavor, this is it, folks!  Excellent in all recipes we have tried, and really yummy on deviled eggs.  I recommend it highly!--Bob

### good strong oolong
This is a strongly flavored, astringent oolong tea.  It is reasonably priced (that is priced as a beverage) and the same tea being sold at several times the cost by various vendors pushing it for its weight loss properties. It produces a cloudy, medium brown brew with strong, slightly rough flavor. Oolongs from this particular location are reputed to aid in losing weight.  I prefer smoother oolongs with a lighter, clearer brew, but this is a matter of taste.  This is a good, solid but not inspiring tea.

### Taste is individual
I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

### Wake up coffee
This is great wake up coffee yes it is bitter but what serious wake up coffee<br />is not? I found the best way to deal with that is to mix it with a french vanilla or toffee k-cup<br />to bring down the bitterness and add coffee mate french vanilla creamer I keep adding the creamer  until the bitter is<br />gone and what you end up with after is this a great tasting coffee that wakes you up even if you did not sleep much<br />i find this cup of coffee has that punch when you need a punch in the face to wake up I don't use it every day<br />but the days that i am dragging and want the day to end this is the antidote for those kind of i want sleep but a can't days<br />and there is just to much to do and no energy to do it days so if you are one of those that needs more energy or likes strong coffee<br />this k-cup is for you! you can't go wrong hope this was a help thanks for ready Mike!

### Great Salt
I switched to this salt years ago as I was cutting refined foods out of my families diets. At least to the extent that I can control at home. This tastes good, has a full spectrum of natural minerals and comes from right here in the good ol'USA. I have had a couple of bags that had some sandy grit in it though. Not enough to bother us or make me quit using it. They make a coarse grind too that you put in a salt grinder. I actually like it more for table use and the fine grind for cooking.

### Doctors said to discontinue due to highest arsenic levels of any formula out there
After consulting with many doctors in our area, ww decided to discontinue this formula.  The high levels of inorganic arsenic in this formula are believed to increase the risk of many cancers, diabetes etc.  Although we have been feeding this stuff to our baby for about 6 months, the doctors said it is no cause for alarm, but to be on the safe side to change to any formula that does not contain brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient, until more studies have been completed.  It is astounding to me that the brown rice syrup is not regularly being tested by Nature's one because he FDA does not have any firm standards for arsenic.  What a cop out.  This is completely irresponsible considering its the main ingredient.  I did a lot of research before feeding this to my child and wanted to believe that this was the best formula out there but I feel like we have been let down.  I guess I have to rethink that idea that anything labeled "organic" is made with purest, ethical ingredients.  Anyway, I know other formulas have their drawbacks too (hexane, etc), but they are much lower risk than the inorganic arsenic which i read takes about 2-3 days clear half of it from the body and about 7 months eliminate all of it.  Look elsewhere.

### Reluctant to order but VERY happy I did.
I was reluctant to order this item due to the negative reviews.  However, I bit the bullet and subscribed because I LOVE this coconut milk. I have been buying it from the health food store and love it but not the price.  Well, I received my first order and it was perfect.  It was very well packed (no dented cans).  The cans are exactly what they are from the store with product originating in Thailand.  The price when subscribing is amazing and it is the perfect food!  It is an addition to most of my paleo and primal recipes.<br /><br />I love Amazon because I have only complained about 1 order (I order from Amazon very regularly) and they made it right immediately.  That's why I wasn't too worried to order this milk.  I am soooo glad I did.

### They taste organic.
I love lollipops but I am also always trying to cut out calories, fat, sugar, and chemicals from my diet. These YummyEarth Lollipops had an interesting mix of flavors, had some natural sugars/ingredients, and were fairly low in calories (70 for 3). So I decided to try them.<br />I found all the flavors to be a bit sour. I expected Pomegranate Pucker and Sour Apple Tart to be sour but I thought the rest would be a bit sweeter since the first ingredient is Cane Juice - Sugar. These are a quality product and taste fine but I would NOT order them again. I like sour candy but these do nothing to curb my sweet tooth.<br /><br />-------<br />Sour Apple Tart- One of my favorites, tastes a bit like apple juice, and isn't nearly as sour as the name suggests.<br /><br />Pomegranate Pucker- I thought this tasted like a raspberry grape flavor. Definitely tart.<br /><br />Very Very Cherry- I don't normally care much for cherry flavor but this one is quite good. Tastes like those Minute Made Popsicle type things but less sweet more bitter.<br /><br />Googly Grape- Love the name. Reminded me of grape jolly ranchers (sour) but with a bit of grape juice flavor mixed in.<br /><br />Mango Tango- So pretty, one of the least tart, but very synthetic tasting. I have only ate one and it gave me a headache. My mom and sister enjoy this flavor though.<br /><br />TooBerry Blueberry- Good taste a bit tart but not much. It'd be nice if the white stripe were cream flavored but that wouldn't be very vegan.<br /><br />Strawberry Smash- Tastes like strawberry juice and has a good flavor to it but again tiny bit sour.<br /><br />Wet-Face Watermelon- I love love love watermelon but (you guessed it) not this one. It was sour and synthetic tasting.<br /><br />I would give this product more stars if a couple of the flavors had a touch more sweetness to them.

### Delicious! I have all five Tisano teas... Fragrant, Chocolatey, and Lush
Updated May 2012.<br /><br />I wanted to update this review because I wanted to compliment Tisano on all of the teas - I have now ordered and tried all of them!<br /><br />I want to highly recommend all of these Cacao Teas- they are particularly delicious! I am fondest of the pure Cacao tea, but the Rooibos, Dragonwell, Mate, and Hojicha are all amazing as well.<br />You can't go wrong.<br /><br />I am impressed! Tisano teas are absolutely delicious. Simple, organic ingredients - the Rooibos one is just Cacao shells, Rooibos, and vanilla beans.<br />Every time I open the tin, the fragrance is very lush - like a fine bar of chocolate.<br /><br />I have been using my french coffee press to make my Tisano cacao tea. Its very easy to make - just measure out the amount of tea you want, and pour freshly boiled filtered water into the press, which releases the most beautiful fragrance!<br /><br />The taste of the Rooibos tea is very lush - so chocolatey but with the added complexity of rooibos and vanilla. I added some milk to mine and it is just delicious.<br />It is also excellent all by itself.<br /><br />The Dragonwell is clean, simple, flavorful and just perfect. I love the Mate Cacao blend most for when I am studying - Mate really helps clear the fog out in your head!<br /><br />The Hojicha is just what you would expect - gorgeous - chocolately, kind of toasty. Perfect.<br /><br />Tisano has a good thing going!!<br /><br />P.S. They have excellent customer service. I had a handwritten thank you note from the company's founder, Patrick, written on my packing slip, thanking me for being a repeat customer, and a sample package of some chocolate nibs, which might be my favorite thing on earth : )  Plus, he's good looking, what more could a girl ask for?<br /><br />Thanks Patrick!!

### Really Good If You Make A Few Adjustments
I won't eat most light or fat free dressings because if you read the label, what they take out, they generally replace with sugar and sugar spikes my appetite big time and yet, a 1 TBS serving of my favorite regular Hidden Valley Ranch dressing doesn't even begin to cover my salad the way I'd like. I'd need at least 3 TBS to make it how I want and that's just too much fat for one meal. It's almost the RDA for an entire day so that's not really feasible for me.<br /><br />What to do??<br /><br />I was THRILLED to find this dressing at my local supermarket. I think it tastes "okay" right out of the bottle but to my tastebuds, it does leave something to be desired. To make it into something I look forward to eating, I do the following:<br /><br />Hidden Valley Ranch has such a strong flavor so I can take 1 TBS of it, 2 TBS of Walden Farms Ranch dressing and approximately 2 TBS of water. Mix well and I have enough dressing for a good sized salad - about 1.5 to 2 cups of greens and it tastes GOOD to me. I don't feel at all deprived and I'm getting fewer calories (there are 70 calories in 1 TBS of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing) and it's plenty thick for what I want it to do and that's cover the salad. I don't want it drenched exactly but I want that ranch flavor with every bite. I eat this dressing almost exclusively now on any kind of salad - turkey taco, chef, asian greens, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes I'll add 1 TBS of flaxseed oil to the mix to get the benefit of the omega 3's however, be aware that 1 TBS of flaxseed oil has approximately 120 calories in it so if you're watching calories then take that into consideration.<br /><br />The above recipe is also not a bad dip for veggies though it is somewhat thin in consistency. I like it best on salads.

I discovered this seasoning ten years ago.  A local grocery store sold this item on a regular basis.  When they closed I tried searching other stores with no luck.

I thought I'd try this stuff since it got so many positive reviews.  Unfortunately, to me, it does not taste good either by itself or blended with something else.  I tried it in a berry smoothie and blended it into a green tea latte, and sadly, neither was positively augmented.  It does have a unique taste as other reviewers have suggested, it just isn't a GOOD taste.  I'm guessing a spoonful of powdered dirt would not taste much worse than a spoonful of this.  And the flavor is too overpowering.  You cannot sneak this into a smoothie without noticing it.  I'm glad I tried it, just disappointed I don't like it.

### Just blah...
It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!

### Super bargain!
I ordered two 2 lb bags of tea. The first one looked like a standard 2 lb bag but I couldn't understand why the shipping carton was so big. Then I removed the peppermint bag and all was revealed: By measurement, the 2 lb peppermint bag was 4-5 times the volume of the other 2 lb bag. In other words, you are going to get a lot of tea for your money. I experimented with amount needed to brew a good tasting batch and I found that I should use the same amount (volume) I would of a heavier tea. Therefore, you are getting 4-5 times the amount of brewed tea for the same price. The tea tastes very good, about four and a half stars. I made it five stars because of the super bargain. The taste is very minty with a subtle bitter tea back taste. I don't use sweetener but this is one tea that might improve with a little.

If all "regular" sodas were like this, sodas would be only tolerated, not drunk by the gallons by a large percentage of the population.  That's not to say that "regular" sodas are good, I don't like them anymore either since eliminating high fructose corn syrup from my diet.  This has a very bland taste & a horrible cling-to-the-back-of-the-tongue aftertaste.  I use stevia all the time & was surprised at the odd flavor.  This also does not taste anything like Mt. Dew.
