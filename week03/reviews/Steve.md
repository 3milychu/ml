I no longer need to search for a canister of Nestles hot cocoa. As the stores that carry it dwindled, I became more and more frustrated. Now, I know where I can find it at the tip of my fingers. I did have to buy 4, but that was no problem, as I share it with family members who were having the same problem.

### Great product, but need better support and information
This Formula is great product overall.We used it for 11 months now and ever since we switched from Similac, our baby haven't had stomach cramps.<br />Company had couple things happened in the past, like  their product  just disappeared from shelves in stores , and no information from company had been issued for a while ( which is scary for consumers, it happens after melanin contamination hit news media ). Also they had contamination of some of their baby food jars as well. They are also very slow and expensive to ship products from their site, which was the reason I used Amazon.I think company should provide better information to consumers and better supply to local stores as well.

My husband and I try not to drink any soda, diet or regular but I saw this on special on Amazon and got some. Really great flavor! My husband who likes regular soda when he can get it (we drink alot of iced tea and coffee) enjoyed this and all the flavors were a surprise! The flavor that was supposed to be like Mountain Dew was just gross to us, nasty so I took one star off for that flavor. The Dr Pepper version and the ginger ale were the best. I would still buy this in a mix and will give the Mt Dew flavor to my son:o)

The title says it all.  This is pretty good malt, but I suspect the formula has changed over the years.  I grew up in Racine, Wisconsin where Horlick's originated.  When we could aford a malted milk we had to have Horlick's malt as the competetion's malt was so inferior.  Again, not quite as good as 50 years ago, but still the best I have been able to find.

### Tasty Ramen with a kick
The first time I tried this I thought it was very tasty and very spicy. Now, after my 4th package, it is just very tasty and almost not spicy enough!  It definitely grew on me - very delicious and addictive!<br />I DO wish there was a low sodium version however; 1040mg of sodium in 1 pkg is just too much. (Are you listening Nong Shim?) Something with this much spice and flavor does not need as much salt so I will definitely have to eat them sparingly, if I can resist the temptation!

My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't "kick in" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it.

### Great cleanser...but watch the eyes!
I have very sensetive skin (and very hard water!) so it's hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritate or dry out my skin. Albas Pinapple face wash is gentle, cleans my face very well and has a wonderful, refreshing pineapple scent to it. A small amount worked into a lather in your hands will do the job. Why only 4 stars? It's VERY thick and needs a little extra time to wash off. I've opened my eyes in the shower a few times thinking this was rinsed clean only to find excess pineapple enzyme wash in my eyes...and it stings! This is the only face wash I've used like that which is very odd. I attribute it to its thick texture and the fact that I have very hard water. Be careful with this! Make sure it's rinsed really really well before you open up your eyeballs. Other than that, it's a great product and my favorite facial cleanser :)

i like the idea behind this product. Slow burning carbs, sustained energy. And it does provide just that. However, the taste is a little iffy. Its not horrible, but i have tasted other bars that are much better. The savior in these bars is the chunks of berries that are contained throughout, as they provide a balance to the not so good tasting stuff inbetween. Either way, these are healthy, good for you, and if the company can work on the taste, i would give them 5 starts.

### Expensive, but it worked!
I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with "meal" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.

These crackers/crisps are very dry and not very savory. They definitely bear the taste of the garbanzo beans that are baked into them (they kind of taste like hummus in solid form), but other than that, there isn't really any flavor, not even from the garlic or salt on the list of ingredients. These definitely need to be serveda s pictured on the package: with some kind of flavorful topping, like feta cheese -- and definitely also with a drink, at least a glass of water. The crisp alone will leave your mouth completely dry. I get that it's supposed to be healthy, but it definitely disappoints in the taste and texture department.

### snack food heaven
These are wonderful!  They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering.  The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like "hint of oreo" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, "well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."

### great alternative to bottled green tea
The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something "healthlier." I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is.

### somewhat misleading...
I saw this product recommended in a cookbook, and couldn't wait to try it.  I am a vegan, so I went to the product website to check the ingredients. Surprisingly, the website did not have a list of ingredients, but it did specify that the product is "a zero calorie, zero fat, vegetarian and kosher seasoning that makes everything taste like bacon."  I ordered the BaconSalt, but was very disappointed when it arrived.  The ingredients are extremely unhealthy...I would never put this on my food.  Among other things that I can't pronounce, this product contains corn syrup, monosodium glutamate, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, hydrolyzed corn and soy proteins, artifical flavor, yellow 6 and red 40.  So YES, it is vegetarian (not vegan...it contains lactic acid, and the red food coloring is derived from insects), but NO, it is NOT a healthy product.  So unless you're one of those vegans who lives on french fries and diet soda, this is NOT a product you want in your spice cabinet.  I wish there had been a product review on BaconSalt when I researched it on Amazon.  I definitely would not have bought it if I had known how unhealthy this seasoning is.  You'd be better off eating bacon!

### convenient, slight hospital taste, alcohol based sugars
To be honest, I was not expecting much. What can 1.62 ounces of tea really do? I expected to get about 4 or 5 teas, and not much else, despite the claim to many servings. However, this is a nice product and might be better for others.<br /><br />1. The taste reminds me too much of a hospital, maybe its just the peach flavor, but it reminded me of it (and I wasn't alone with this opinion)<br />2. You really can get a lot of servings out of it. The measure is very unscientific (they define a servings as a "squirt", which as you might guess varies quite a bit. A strong squirt? A quick squirt? A you-hold-for-a-second squirt? Who knows, but it falls somewhere in between. In general a strong squirt can give a bit of flavor to a 12 ounce glass of water.<br />3. Its convenient as it mixes very easy with water. If you are not picky, you don't even have to stir it. For a consistent taste, you can just stif for 2 seconds. If you want it sweeter, just keep adding squirts, (3 squirts on a 12 ounce glass makes for a very sweet tea, I wouldn't recommend more than that)<br /><br />Another positive in my book is the use of alcohol based/type sugars, as opposed to high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />However, at around $5 dollars per 1.6 ounce jar, it's quite expensive. I would say you get 20 decent size servings out of it, that comes out to 25 cents per strong squirt. Maybe the convenience is worth it.<br /><br />If it weren't for the hospital taste, I'd give it 4 stars.

### So Delish!
I was so happy to find these on Amazon.com for a good price with Prime Shipping!<br />I used to buy these at a local Asian market, but that area of town is hard for me to get to these days and I rarely make the trip.<br />I fell in love with the sesame noodles flavor. The noodles are a lot like ramen, but a little lighter than Maruchan/Top. The seasoning is hard to describe. The sesame sauce is not sweet like in Chinese food. It's a savory sesame sauce and the sesame is not overpowering. The hot mustard pack that comes with it is essential to the complete flavor. The spice is not strong (I'm a wimp, trust me. It's not strong.) but the flavor addition is essential to the overall taste of this variety. These are my absolute favorite noodles! :) Great with some added ingredients like sliced cucumber and ham bits, even a cooked egg, but also great alone.

### 5 star tea, 3 star service from Amazon
We love PG Tips and were worried that when we moved to the US that we wouldn't be able to find a cost effective way of getting our teabags.  We use on average 6-8 teabags a day so we really couldn't afford to buy an 80 count box from World Market at $7-9 a piece.  We were thrilled when Amazon started carrying the 2 pack of 240 count boxes with free shipping.<br /><br />So imagine how irritated I was to come back to re-order more teabags (after ordering the same thing from Amazon for over 2 years) to find that they no longer carry that size and that they have pawned off the same exact 2 pack to another company who wants to charge me almost $6 for shipping.  (The new company even have the Amazon "2 pack" symbol on their image which means that Amazon has probably got this company doing fulfillment now.) Shame on Amazon.com - what's the purpose of free shipping or my prime account if you've got someone else selling your product that's going to charge me shipping?<br /><br />So I've had to go with the 160 count pack of 4, but I wouldn't preferred to just order my usual so I don't have open bags going stale.<br /><br />A small rant, I know, but I look for Amazon to be dependable when every other online retailer is not.  Please bring back my 2 pack of 240 count...

### Maybe should call it spicy seaweed soup
Guess I am one of the few that was not real impressed by this flavor.  I did not hate it, but found it only to taste of seaweed rather than seafood.  For some reason I don't classify seaweed as quite making the more generic seafood category.  LOL  That said I did not hate it either.  It was definitely OK for a change of pace, I was not wow'd by the seaweed flavor, and the spicyness was basically a red pepper type spicy.  I am more of a fan of the Nong Shim KimChi soup.  For some reason that one hits the spot for me, and the spicy flavor is different than the normal red pepper flavor that comes across with this soup.

### Actually Bold Coffee
I can't say that Emeril has sponsored a product I like until now. For a K-Cup this coffee is actually close to the flavor that I like in rich freshly ground coffee. I like my coffee strong, and this one delivers where most other "Strong" or "Bold" cups have failed in my opinion. I am only giving it 4 stars, because even though it is the bold K-cup I have tried, I still left wanting bolder. Until that time, when I have time, I will just use fresh ground coffee in my cheap coffee maker. For the everyday brew this product helps me power through.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Actually lives up the the Bold name<br />+Boldest K-cup I have found<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Still not near ground coffees boldness<br /><br />Overall, it is a great product. If you have a stronger K-cup you are currently using in rotation I recommend trying this one. It cost about the same so risk it for a new flavor.

### Finally!
We have a 7 month old Havanese who has a very sensitive stomach.  He came to us with Royal Canin indoor puppy but he was scratching constantly.  I got him some generic puppy food thinking dog food is dog food right?  Wrong!  He ate it and liked it but about a week later had diarrhea.  We didnt know it was the food at first, but after reading the ingredients realized it was the corn in it causing his reaction.  I then began to do research and switched him to Nutro small bites with chicken meal, rice and oatmeal, also a bad idea.  He didnt even eat it, I mixed it with some chicken broth, which helped, but then the diarrhea returned.  So, I finally found Orijen!  I wish I had just gotten it in the first place.  He loves it and always begs for more although we don't give in because I dont want to over feed him.  But, there is no more itching, his poop is firm and round and since we're not feeding him as much now, the cost is not a factor.  I would definitely recommend this food to everyone.

This is a great coffee. Has a very unique taste so you have to love coffee with a little flare. It is fresh and great for an afternoon break. Adda scone with lots of whipped cream for a moment of heaven. These are pods so you cannot use it in your Keurig but in a regular coffee pot use it instead of a filter.

### No more fighting with the dog about his pills!
These things are AWESOME! I've tried giving my dog his pills in everything from cheese- to sandwich meat- and finally liverwurst- all of which worked... for a while. Eventually though he would start chewing whatever it was to locate the medication in whatever treat it was and spit the pills out. Over And Over. SO frustrating. He has three pills to take twice daily and I can fit all three of them in one Greenie... These pill pockets actually have him reminding ME that it's time to take them.  Of course you could try something else that's cheaper- and I've done that- but when you find you're spending too much time fighting your best friend to treat a chronic condition and keep him with you- reach for these. They are worth every penny! There's no more fighting-, and no sad-dog hiding under the furniture.

I love this product!  My dog would not chew on toys or rawhide things and her teeth were getting brown in the back from just foods she ate without cleaning them. My vet told me about Greenies, so I went on a search online for the best prices. They are wonderful, she gets one a day, chews it so it actually is helping with her teeth cleaning. It's all natural and even her breath smells better :)

I never knew Kona coffee even existed until I visited and commented on how good the coffee was while I was vacationing in Hawaii. The locals knew and smiled when I asked what kind it was. This is really good coffee. I tried Kona along the way but found out a lot are blends of Kona and other beans. The price is good and it's actually a full pound, not like others have done to skimp in order to offer a more competitive price. This coffee was nice and fresh, unlike other reviews mentioned.

### Used to be a bargain
Yamazaki 12 used to be a bargain when it was at the $28 price per bottle. Somewhere along the way, they got too big for their britches, and have been demanding more for their product.<br />While a decent Scotch-like whisky, they're too expensive when you can get similar for less - that is, you can buy a REAL scotch. For less.<br /><br />For about the same price, a Dalwhinnie 15 is superior.<br /><br />And the 18year Suntory selling for $109 to $140? Laughable when you can buy a Glenlivet Archive 21 year for the same price.<br /><br />In conclusion, this was once a good alternative to scotch when they were cheaper. At their current prices, this does not compete well with all the great Speyside or Highland whiskys to be had for much cheaper.

I have been looking for organic San Marzano tomatoes for some time and now I have it!  Thanks so much.  I have two issues, though.<br /><br />1.  It was not clear to me prior to my purchase that these cans already have "BASIL LEAF" in them and I would not have preferred that as I add my own fresh basil<br /><br />2.  Two of the cans were pretty dented--do you think this is a problem?  Or...was it damaged in transit.  It was double boxed.<br /><br />Otherwise I will be making several batches of marinara sauce.

### Unusable stuff with a "no return" policy
I'm giving 2 stars only because I own some responsibility for not finding a way to taste this "sweetener" before ordering 6 bags of it. I bought it for making Kombucha, and when I poured in the "Rapunzel Pure Organic Whole Cane Sugar", it looked like I had poured in a cup and a half of dirt. Not to worry. I can take ugly as long as it's healthy, but my batch of Kombucha , after 8 days, is an opaque, sour, slurry of a mess, totally undrinkable, not like any Kombucha you've ever seen, and I'm just hoping I haven't ruined my SCOBY.<br />I'm a health food person, have been for many, many years, so I don't expect organic, healthy foods to taste like a Dairy Queen shake, but it should be somewhat palatable and interchangeable with unhealthy foods, i.e. processed sugar.<br />Since I can't return the 5 sealed, untouched bags, I'll stick them in my WTSHTF disaster preparedness stash. If the economy crashes, or we get some other apocalyptic disaster, I might be glad to have it, even if it tastes like burnt caramel, has little sweetening value, and looks like dirt.

### Pretty darn good
Me recently: "Waaah, why does everybody have to make black licorice using wheat flour??"<br />Me last night holding my 2nd empty Orgran bag in that many days: "Waaah! Why did someone have to go and make such a good GF black licorice??" :)<br /><br />I'm a licorice-lover whose favorite self-pampering before the Celiac was to binge on a box of chewy Panda brand black licorice. Orgran has almost (not quite) hit the mark. I will admit that I was disappointed when I first tasted it, because the flavor is more molasses than licorice to me. However, it grew on me at black-light speed, and I'm way past "liking" to serious "craving" now. It gives the old jaw a bit of a workout, with its relative toughness, and of course I wish it were less expensive since it is (for me) habit-forming, but it still gets 5 stars because I am so happy to have found a replacement for my long-pined-after Panda (even if I am eating so much I'm bound to "expanda")!

As a suggestion; I like to mix my 2oz shot with Gatorade or juice of some kind.

### My dog Chablis loves these treats!!!!!!
This seller provides swift service.  I have ordered the dog treats twice---the last time, I ordered four pounds so I will have tons on hand.  Chablis, my little Chines crested, is crazy about these treats, and, because she's is inordinately "picky" about what she ingests, I practically shriek when I find something she enjoys eating.  Of course, I watch her while she feasts on the wrap, and she doesn't really eat the sweet potato part, but she practically swoons with joy when they appear.  I give her two a day, and she gnaws away--good tooth work---and I figure she gets some sweet potato along with the chicken.  I like the fact that the treats aren't huge, that she plays with them, and feels like she's been indulged.  Absolutely a good purchase for me.

### Solved Dogs' Digestive Problems
I added two Schipperke puppies to my home eight years ago.  Shortly after they arrived, they became sick with a parasite known as coccidia.  From that moment on, I lived a wretched existence comprised of constant cleaning (both the dogs and anything they came near), dog antibiotics, vet bills, emergency room visits, more vet bills, on and on.  By the time they were two years of age, they were down to eating only rice mixed with turkey baby food (per vet instructions) and my bank account was depleted by thousands of dollars.  Yet still they suffered from diarrhea and occasional bouts of vomiting.  One day I found this food on the internet, and thought, "what the hell - I've tried everything else."  When the food arrived, I mixed the "dust" (reminded me of fish chum we used as kids) with cooked turkey, water, and olive oil.  I fed it to the dogs.  They loved it, but I expected after a year of rice and Gerber's, they'd have loved anything.  By day three, their diarrhea had stopped, and the only time it has returned in the past six years is when I have run out of this food and fed them something different.  Truly.  Day THREE!  After a two-year ordeal! This food saved my dogs' lives.  I notice that the formula has changed a bit over the years, and now the package directions suggest adding an egg and fish oil - and not to use olive oil.  I just keep making it the way I always have.  They still love it.<br /><br />There are downsides to using this food:  it's soft, so plaque and tartar build up much faster than if the dogs were eating crunchy food.  Also, I have to make a "batch" of food for them. I usually buy 2-1/2 lbs. of ground turkey, cook it up, grind it in the food processor, add it to 2 cups of dust, 2-1/2 cups of water, 1/4 cup olive oil, then mix it all together.  Then, using a small ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), I put the food into those small disposable plastic containers made by Glad.  This usually gives me 56 containers (two weeks' worth of breakfast and dinner for both dogs).  I freeze the containers, putting them into the refrigerator the night before as necessary.  In the morning, I dump the containers in their bowls, and microwave for 20 seconds.  I guess this is a long way of saying it's more labor intensive than throwing a handful of kibble into a bowl.  But, it has definitely been worth it for me and my dogs.<br /><br />I would enthusiastically recommend this food to any pet owner.

I normally try various mustards, and have often had a small 'collection' to vary.  Nowadays, I limit myself to a handful, this being one of them, and I find it particularly tasty on turkey and chicken breast.

### Not a balanced meal -
If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.
