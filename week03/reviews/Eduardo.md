### Tastes like coffee smells
I have finally found a coffee that tastes like coffee smells.  That elusive taste we all look for when we smell coffee brewing.  A nice robust (but not too strong) flavor that tastes great without cream and/or sugar, but its flavor is not diluted when I add flavored cream, just enhanced.

### More Like 3 and a Half Stars I Suppose
Well, it's difficult to review something like this coz after all, I didn't eat any of it.  But I have three judges at home and as it stands, it's two to one on this food.  One cat likes it and the other wants nothing to do with it.  The dog loves it though!<br />It comes in those little tin cans like Fancy Feast, and you get an decent enough amount I suppose.  It seems a tad pricey, but that's for you to decide.<br />So there you have it-Approved by one dog and one cat.  But bear in mind the third cat is a VERY picky eater.

It's still pretty sweet. I'd call it sweet snack than meal replacement.<br />When I have less than satisfying meal, I would eat it for desert. For me it's canndy bar replacement.<br />I feel guilty eating it instead of a meal.<br /><br />Everything is laced with so much sugar now days, when I eat something for health, I want no sugar or very little sugar in it.<br />This bar would taste even better if it were less sweet.

### Crunchy, salty, sweet...finally, a Superbowl snack that scooores!
These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.<br /><br />These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

Lets see if the person packing notices that its not one item, but 1 set of a dozen this time. By the way....the issue of little tips/caps. One reviewer said to try vacuum caps. I went to the local auto parts store and didn't find any that fit, and at a cost of $8 for 5, I think not. I was browsing a hardware store and saw thread protectors. Yellow ones are a perfect fit!

### Better than expected
I have been considering going gluten free, due to health concerns and as I am reading the book "Wheat Belly."  I purchased this mix to play around with the gluten free thing.  I was rather impressed with the end result, except for one main thing - the instructions say to NOT oil the pan, and as I figured when even the dough stuck to the pan, I was unable to get my pizza off the pan without a big mess.  I did notice that it was a bit easier after it had cooled a bit.  I would think that perhaps some corn starch on the cooking pan may have helped this, but I am not much of a cook and the instructions make no mention of any additional steps.  I also only managed to cook the pizza for about 10 of the 15 minimum minutes, as the cheese was starting to get too brown.  I did however enjoy the taste, which I consider to be quite acceptable as a pizza lover.  It's not a replica of your favorite pizza joint, but for instance I think this wins hands down over the pillsbury refrigerated dough mix!  An added bonus:  I haven't had to sprint to the bathroom after eating it!  I would like more information about the modified tapioca ingredient, and I notice Chebe gives some explanation on its website, but I find it a bit confusing.

### About the product and packaging/shipping which affects the product
Note: I'm discussing the packaging and shipping issues here because I was not able to do so via Amazon's special feedback section for packaging and shipping and there is no way to contact Deals on Call LLC that I can find, but I wanted them to be aware of this. It is also relevant as it affects the product you may purchase for yourself or others--especially if you're having it shipped as a gift to others. I'm taking the time to write this to give you information you may want and to save you time.<br /><br />Had researched this product online as I had seen it mentioned (with praise) on several TV shows, as a gift for my many bacon-loving friends. Was a bit concerned about whether or not it required special packaging (cooling, etc.) during shipping after reading some comments here on amazon and elsewhere. (My personal experience with items that require any sort of special cooling, etc. is that stuff arrives in unusable state. This is often the fault of the carrier, FedEx, UPS, etc. rather than the manufacturer or shipper.)<br /><br />Called the company in Seattle (Skillet Street Food) and asked whether the product required cooling/refrigerating during shipment. Answer: No. (Information was not on website. Had also sent an email suggesting they add that information AND the nutritional content on their Web site. When it comes to food products, you can NEVER have too much information. I was surprised that I had not found it in the info about the product in the Amazon listing either.)<br /><br />I then ordered the three pack (cheapest option price wise). Paid for next-day delivery and it arrived in less than 24 hours. Excellent.<br /><br />Opened the smallish box. Now given the size of the three jars and the box, there was not enough of those packing pillows to hold it in place and it was clear that the three jars (placed inside a simple plastic bag and not fixed in place via any method) had moved around during shipping. Plastic jars not damaged, but they easily could have been from hitting each other during handling, etc.<br /><br />The first thing I wanted to check was the seals as my research said that if the seal is broken, the product has been compromised and you cannot eat it (See info to come from the company.) Well, the lid on one of the jars was open and loose, there was some greasy film around the rim of the jar...and when I opened it, half of the seal was open and the jam was coming out.<br /><br />Now, this is actually good news. It alerted me that the jar had been compromised and I immediately tossed it. (The seals on the other two jars were fine; no film; lids secure.)<br /><br />Called Amazon customer service and explained what happened; it was unclear to me who had handled, packed and shipped the actual order--amazon or Deals On Call LLc. Still not sure. I requested a replacement jar, which they could not do, but they did refund me the entire amount so I could reorder another three jars, which I will do.<br /><br />It is still unclear WHEN the seal came open and what caused it. Because of what I do in my "real" life, I'm a stickler about health and safety issues. Since it was unclear as to who did the actual handling, packing and shipping of the bacon jam jars for this order, and I could not contact the vendor (Deals On Call LLC) directly to relay the problem about what may have happened in shipping, I did ask Amazon to do so. And I'm sharing it here.<br /><br />But I went a step further because this is the product of a small-biz in Seattle and having seen the web site for the company, where they actively solicit feedback, I thought it made sense to alert them to this issue so they could possibly alert the folks who buy from them to be aware that seals could come open after the product left Skillet Street Foods and was handled elsewhere (retail, etc.).<br /><br />When I reached them (no annoying voicemail but an actual person responsible for the product who was professional and courteous), the person explained how units are checked individually to ensure seals are secure, before they are lidded and sent on their way. He also knew the vendor associated with this Amazon purchase, and could vouch for their reliable and professional service (which I assumed given their high ratings on amazon). More importantly, he said he would discuss the packaging issues<br /><br />Net-net: Seals can open, but this is apparently rare. You should be alert. If the seal is open, air has gotten into the jar and the jam should NOT be eaten. (This could explain why some folks have had an issue with the taste while others are raving about the jam.)<br /><br />>>Jars are shelf-stable until open. Once open, they must be refrigerated. There is a use by date on the bottom of each jar. You can freeze the jam if not opened and used by that date (good to know).<br /><br />Again, this information is not on the Skillet Street Web site that I could find (as of this writing) and not here on amazon posting. It should be added. Along with the nutritional information and ingredients.<br /><br />This is what is on the jar itself:<br /><br />"Store it in the fridge, serve it at room temp and use or freeze by date printed on bottom of container."<br /><br />FYI: Just reading that wording, it's unclear whether "store it in the fridge" applies to when you receive it. Or after you open it.<br /><br />Perhaps the wording should be revised so it says. "Refrigerate after opening." As so many labels do, to differentiate from those that require no special handling or those that say "Keep refrigerated."<br /><br />One should never assume that it's clear. Example: We buy pickles in a jar. They are shelf stable. Until we ordered a new kind. Imagine our surprise, when opening several days later, they were off. Our bad because we had NOT read the packaging which said: Keep refrigerated. It was delivered with other groceries when we were not at home or we might have noted that it was with the refrigerated items in our order, not the canned/bottled items!<br /><br />Nutritional Data:<br />Serving size: 1 Ounce<br />Servings per container: 7<br /><br />Calories: 80<br />Calories from fat: 60<br /><br />Total fat: 6 g, 10% (Saturated fat, 2g, 9%)<br />Cholesterol: 10 mg, 3%<br />Sodium: 350 mg, 14%<br />Total Carb.: 3g, 1% (Dietary fiber: 0%)<br />Sugars: 3g<br />Protein: 4g<br /><br />Ingredients: Uncured bacon, no nitrite or nitrate added except those naturally occuring in Celery Powder (pork prepared with: water, salt, turbinado sugar, celery powder, lactic acid, starter culture (not from milk), Onion, Balsamic vinegar (organic wine vinegar [from juice of organic grapes]; organic, concentrated grape must; organic caramel sugar), Brown Sugar (sugar, invert sugar, cane molasses), Water, Salt, Pepper.<br /><br />FYI: that "concentrated grape must" is not a typo. I will google this as I am now curious what must is.<br /><br />I can't speak to the taste of this as these are gifts. However, once my recipients report back, I will add this feedback.<br /><br />Very impressed by Skillet Street Foods as the creater/manufacturer of the jam who appears genuinely interested in improving all aspects of product and delivery, and, as always, very pleased that Amazon could deal with the problem quickly and easily.<br /><br />Would have been happy with just a replacement jar but Amazon went the extra mile.<br /><br />Hope that the nutritional information and ingredients and the details about usage will be added to the Skillet Street Food online shop and to any listing/posting where this product is sold.<br /><br />I'm actually surprised that this information is not readily available. A few friends told me that they will never order any food product without first seeing this information. Which means everyone is losing sales when a product like this is offered without the details. Plus, lots of folks might miss out on what many say is an incredibly tasty and versatile jam!

### Good taste, beans don't always hydrate completely
I've been a McDougall customer since 2004, and I've tried almost all of the food cups.  They are excellent for those who want a vegan, mostly-organic alternative, and of course one pays extra for the convenience and vegan/organic ingredients.<br /><br />The taste of the White Bean & Pasta soup is good, especially for a low-sodium soup, and it's about as filling as a cup this size will get.  It can be eaten as is or poured over pasta, rice, a baked potato, etc.<br /><br />My one complaints is that the beans don't always get completely hydrated (watered), and they can end up a bit "crisp".  Letting the product soak longer doesn't seem to help.

### Not what I hoped for, but probably should've expected
I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that.

### Not suggested for heavy chewers or super smart dogs
I have a toy poodle who is very toy motivated (and heavy into chewing as a puppy to boot), so my husband bought this for her thinking it would keep her occupied, at least for a good 20 minutes. Unfortunately, she had the treat portion out of the rubber holder in less than 5 minutes and our other dog (who, incedentally is food motivated) was eating it, and she was soon looking for something else to chew on as a puppy. The rubber "holder" makes a great throw toy, and is a good food pacer in the bowl of the other dog. It's also good to put a greenie through so they don't eat them too quickly. It is not an everlasting treat at all.

The package arrived a full day early which was great.  The plant itself took about three weeks for it to start growing so be patient.  The only slightly negative thing about it is the can they give you to grown in is very small, other than that everything was great.

### Amazing results!
Trivedi Water!  I recommend it!<br /><br />I have purchased several cases of Trivedi water from Amazon. A friend stopped by this past week with a bouquet of tulips wrapped in wet paper.  She had just purchased them and they were already hanging limply.  I put them in a vase with Trivedi water.  Two days later, those tulips are standing up straight and now five days later they are still standing.  Unbelievable!  Also, I was about to throw out my Christmas poinsettia plant.  The leaves were pretty much withered so I decided to clean it up and water it with Trivedi water.  Well now, there are beautiful little green shoots sprouting all over the stems!  I personally can't seem to drink enough of it.  I notice that my hair is becoming shinier!  Neat!  All good!  I recommend this obviously powerful water to anyone and everyone.

### High octane mint!
This has been my yummy summer treat as part of my iced tea creations I've been making with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J5FN48">Mr. Coffee TM70 3-Quart Iced-Tea Maker</a>. This is the most potent mint flavor you are likely to experience. I use this as part of a mix with either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0IS">Eco Teas Organic Yerba Mate, Loose, 16-Ounces (Pack of 3)</a>or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003OFJ79S">Bigelow® Lemon Ginger Herb Plus Probiotics (Box of 18)</a> most of the time. But I'm still experimenting.<br />I can't address how this product works for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.<br />I can say though that the difference between this and any other mint tea I've encountered so far is dramatic. This is some of the tastiest stuff in the world. I don't see myself willing to be without this product.

### So you want to make Turkish coffee at home?
I had been interested in acquiring an ibrik ever since my first cup of Turkish coffee at Dilettante in Seattle. For some reason I never got around to making the purchase. Well, this was the year I treated myself, and I'm pretty happy with my purchase. This set includes everything that you need to start developing your skill with the ibrik. (And it does take a few tries to get it right.)<br /><br />The ibrik that comes with the set is a nice size for making coffee for one or two, and has a nice brass finish. The coffee samples are fun to play with and a nice introduction to the different ways in which this style of coffee is prepared (and here I mean the different spices or flavors which might be ground with the coffee beans). Finally, the cups are a nice way to serve it and match the size of the ibrik very well.<br /><br />Tip: I found that I needed to scrub the inside of the ibrik to get it clean before its first use, which would have been very difficult if I hadn't had an old baby bottle brush laying around.

### Great product for the money
When you live in SW Florida on an island, you don't find many options to purchase bulgur wheat.  So I was delighted to find it online at a good price. The only caveat I would give to new customers to bulgur is that the package recipe tells you to add twice the amount of liquid to wheat. I use a ratio of 1:1, which maintains the nice 'chew' to the finished product; 2:1 and you have mush!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OOW3K">Bob's Red Mill Light Bulgur (ALA) Soft Wheat -- 28 oz</a>

### Excellent tasting jelly beans, but the basket is a bit small for the price
I bought two of these for corporate Christmas gifts and though everyone loved the world famous jelly beans, I was disappointed at the thin basket and rather "small" look to it. I also bought the larger rectangular box of Jelly Bellies (reminded me of the size of a Monopoly game box) and added it to the basket to make it look more substantial. I think next year I will just get more of the box jelly beans.

### The best Kitten food!
I have been feeding this food to my Ragdoll kittens/cats for years. The Blue Buffalo Spa Selects are the best food I have found for my kitties. I have one that has a sensitive stomach and will not keep any grain foods down. With Blue Buffalo Kitten, she has never gotten sick and loves it! I have Tom that was frequently getting urinary crystals. He hated the Hills Prescription Diet A/D food the vet wanted him to eat, canned or dry, but this stuff he loves. Kittens have grown strong and healthy with beautiful coats!<br />I have noticed also, for anyone considering switching to this food versus most others, because this food is very digestible, they eat less of it, process more of it, and actually seem to use the catbox less! With other grainy foods, they have trouble processing the cornmeal and it just passes through the system, creating more bowel movements, and eating more food. You can even SEE, if you look, the grains in my cats' stool with other brands compared to grain-free brands.<br />This at least is the case with my cats.

Not to mention he is overall pretty well off and has a great coat! I took it out of the bag and put it in several tupper wear containers to keep it from going stale as there is no way to reseal the bag after you open it. PS I have not noticed if my cats poop is any smellier with this vrs other brands but i will say he throws up less!

### Tastes "burned"
I was looking for a caffeinated interim substitute for the Gevalia Espresso pods that are recalled/back-ordered/out-of-stock/overpriced at the moment.  Even though it isn't espresso, I thought we'd try this since some reviewers said it was more like European coffee (which is actually just espresso).  My husband has worked at Starbucks for many years. He took one sip and made a bad face.  He said it tasted like the beans had been over-roasted and the shot over-extracted. Well, I guess he's stuck with three packs of this because we can't return to two unopened packages! Bummer. Here's hoping the Gevalia espresso is back in stock once he's through those 48 t-discs.

### Very Tasty for a Decaf!
You can still get more flavor in a fully caffeinated green tea, but this is green, clean, and refreshing.  It is not at all bitter as long as you pull the tea bag out in 1-2 min, and it has forgiven longer steeps as well.  The flavor is warm and mellow with some grassy tones, but the grassy tones are not overwhelming.  Light, all-day tea that's good cold as well.  I'll sometimes put a bag into cold or room-temperature tea to flavor the water deliciously without adding heat to a summer day.<br /><br />I often mix this with other flavors to cut the caffeine in half, or mix it with other decaf flavors (like herbal mint) for variation.<br /><br />Be advised this box came with the tea bags smashed in pretty densely.  The quality wasn't compromised, but they would make for poor gifts and their resell appeal would take a hit.<br /><br />As with any 100-count box, I recommend picking up a single box of this at a local grocery store if you can before committing to so many.  It's available at most of my local grocery stores, and might be available at yours as well.

### Very tasty, changed recipe a bit
I've used it three times so far and it was great all three times and it makes outstanding leftovers (I used 3 packets at once last time!).  I added the spice packet two times but I wasn't all that thrilled with bitting into bits and pieces of the various parts while I ate.  So the last time I made it I first started with the butter and added the spice packet (simmer according to instructions).  Next I added 1.5 cups of water then I let this simmer.<br /><br />Next I prepared the veggies.  The first time I didn't use the lemon curd as instructed.  The second time I did.  The third time I used plain yogurt (6oz per packet).  The lemon was my least favorite and the yogurt was my most favorite.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes of simmering the spice packet (when the veggie prep was done) I strained the water/spice mix into the veggies.  Then I followed the recipe to the end.

### NOT the Holy Grail
Just finished making a loaf of this bread.  The texture is OK, but the taste is really not good at all.  The flour mix seems to consist mostly of tapioca flour, and it gives the finished loaf a very odd, slightly sour flavor.  The aroma is like a big ball of steamed corn.  This bread basically tastes just like several other brands already on the market, and at $8 (in my supermarket) it isn't exactly a bargain.  Too bad, I was hoping for something better from King Arthur.

### Not quite the same item
I checked the vendor's website (Taylor's Market), and they only picture the item the same as it is shown here. But that isn't what they sent me - "55% Dark Organic Chocolate Covered Cacao Nibs". No mention of dark chocolate covered on Amazon or Taylor's.<br /><br />It's hard to judge the quality of something you've never seen before, but here goes. They seem well made. Deep cocoa aroma in the can. First taste is the dark chocolate, which melts away to the nibs. They are little chunks of roasted cacao bean. The beans are crunchy, a bit bitter and sort of mealy, not smooth. I don't think I'll buy any more, but I got them for our "dark chocolate tasting club" and the adventure of something out of the ordinary. So I'm satisfied with what I got, but the product is not quite as detailed.<br /><br />Ingredients: Dark chocolate (cacao beans, cane sugar, cocoa butter, whole vanilla bean), roasted cacao nibs. All ingredients certified organic. May contain traces of nuts.
