### Great cat treat at wonderful price!!!
This is essentially the same stuff as Kitty Kaviar and other name-brand bonito flake cat treats for a fraction of the price.  Moreover, it's a high-quality, human  consumption grade product, so if you enjoy seasoning with Bonito, it can be a feast for you and your furry friends.  It is quite a large bag, though, so be prepared to make room in the fridge or freezer because it has to be refrigerated after opening.

### Pretty darn good... for just coffee.
What's not to love about a chocolate glazed donut... without all the fat and gluten? Well, don't get your hopes up that this will take you to that place of guiltless indulgence. However, it's still great coffee and has just a hit of chocolate scent to it.  I added sweetener, a little instant cocoa powder, and half-and-half, and THEN it was more like a chocolate glazed donut.  Still good coffee, just wish the flavor was stronger.

### Cincinnati Chilli
As far as I know there is only one supermarket that carries Cincinnati Chilli and that is Krogers (and not all Krogers).  We do not have that chain here in Florida.  I've driven to Georgia to buy it and I've also ordered it by mail.  I'm so glad that Amazon.com carries this.  It's so easy to make; just add the seasoning packet to tomato paste and water, crumble a pound of ground beef and serve it over spaghetti.  Thanks Amazon.com.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CULITU">Hershey's Syrup, Special Dark Chocolate, 22-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Love this stuff, great for making Mocha's, clod or hot. Was buying at The "Big W", but of course, they've stopped carrying it. And it is seemly more difficult, if not impossible, to find from other sources. Is a message being sent? But, for the moment, it is here at Amazon.<br /><br />It may not be as dark as some would like, but it is not as sweet as their regular chocolate syrup and tastes similar to the Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate candies.<br /><br />When I ordered from Amazon the Subscribe and Save pricing was an excellent buy, making this chocolate lovers syrup even more SPECIAL.<br /><br />May the chocolate, dark that is, be with you...

### Blue Buffalo Wilderness Cat Food
My cat isn't very picky but seemed to be having a reaction of some kind to store bought cat food - I feel bad that I was ever feeding him this low quality grocery store food.<br /><br />I looked up on the Internet and found that two of the most recommended cat foods were Wellness Core and Blue Buffalo.  I bought both and my cat much prefers the Blue Buffalo Wilderness as far as dry food goes.  He also eats wet food and he likes the Wellness Healthy Indulgence packets.<br /><br />Anyway, the food change seems to have done the trick.  No more itchy eyes for kitty and he looks great!

### Excellent Coffee!
A few years ago, I worked in a bed and breakfast and one of my favorite parts was the southern pecan coffee. I have since been trying to find a coffee that is comparable. This is it! Like one of the other reviewers, I don't care for super strong coffee. This coffee has a very smooth flavor and the pecan flavor does not take over the coffee...the two work beautifully together!

### A Thoughtful Experience
I love to try new experiences like a new restaurant, a new wine or a tea that I've never tasted before.  While this can be delightful, it can also be a disappointment at times.<br />My first taste of Ran Watte was not delightful.  Then I realized the problem was not the tea.  Being unfamiliar with this larger leaf, I had used to much tea & brewed it to strong.  The second try was perfect for my taste.<br />This tea reminds me of a very light Jasmine tea.  It is wonderful to sip without amendments but a touch of honey would make a great compliment, also.  Most teas this light seem to have little taste which leaves me wondering at the attempt to market them.  This one shows an interesting character, lightly brisk & the slightest hint of salty aftertaste that is unusual but not at all unpleasant.  For my preference, this tea is a great 'afternoon with a good book' kind of tea.

### What a joke - Do not order!
This company is a huge joke. I ordered two plants from this company.  The first plant was dead on arrival.  We paid for expedited shipping and it still never arrived in time frame specified.  No wonder it died. I called the company and could bearly understand the guy.  They said they would send a replacement and it still hasn't arrived.  The plants are nothing like what is pictured in the advertisement.  The second plant is so small, it didn't even have one bloom on it.  I ordered it for my son thinking he could feed it right away and was VERY disappointed in the product.

### Response to the 2-star review...
To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

### We love this dog food.....
We are well into our second month of feeding our 70 pound black lab this excellent high protein dog food.<br /><br />He doesn't shed as much as before, his coat is shiny and very healthy looking.  He has much more energy than when he was on his previous food. And he eats about 1/2 as much as before per serving.  One bag (28.6 lbs) easily lasts him over a month. He only eats what he needs and never gorges himself.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than regular dog food but because it doesn't have the grain and fillers, you get what you pay for.  And besides, our boy is worth the very best.<br /><br />All in all, we are VERY satisfied with this product and we'll be ordering again soon.

I make mine in daily batches since they only eat 1/4 cup twice a day...but it is so quick and so convenient... it literally takes a minute to measure, add water and seal up in a tupperware and refrigerate.  they are so much healthier and have a ton more energy.

However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.<br /><br />Not wanting to waste the coffee, I cut up a bunch and brewed in a regular machine. Overall, it's a fairly mild roast with good strong coffee flavor (if you use enough of it) that has some nice fruity tones.

### Addicted
I'm seriously addicted to these.  The Chocolate Chip is amazing.  The Choco Lot tastes a lot like a brownie, especially when a bit warm.  I was concerned initially by the amount of xylitol (a sugar alcohol) as I'm sensitive to most sugar alcohols. And this has quite a bit (19gm). BUT one cookie doesn't seem to affect me - too much.  Love that they have protein (8gm in a cookie?!?!?) and fiber (2gm).  But mostly I'm hooked on the taste.  I prefer chewy cookies (vs the crunchy kind) so this is perfect for me. AND it's vegan. (Whole Foods bakes a mega-yummy vegan chocolate chip cookie but I know it's packed with sugar, certainly more than the 10gm in a Kookie Karma.)  The only suggestion I would make is to make them just a tad less sweet.  Guilt free indulgence :-)

I thought it was fantastic. It's sweet, but not in a syrupy gross way like a regular soda usually is. I'm used to Diet, and maybe that's the key to appreciating the flavor of this beverage, or maybe its that I have been off soda for a while.

### Perfection
This box is amazing.  It contains all 50 flavors and each in its own compartment.  To make it even more perfect, there is a clear plastic insert that keeps all the jelly beans in their separate compartments and keeps them from getting mixed up when the box is possibly tossed around during shipping.  Not one bean snuck out of its spot.  The flavors are both fascinating and creative and really do taste like what they are supposed to with only a couple exceptions.  They were fun to play with and we took turns blindfolding each other to taste the flavors and see how well we could guess what we just tried.  Some were hard and many were challenging but a few were easy and quick.  It was a fun game and it really was harder than it sounds.  It also made us realize how much taste depends on sight.<br /><br />On the inside of the lid is a picture that shows the jelly beans in their compartments with their name underneath, which really does help tremendously.  The box also gives you ideas for flavor combinations to try, as does the Jelly Belly website, such as blueberry + blueberry + buttered popcorn = blueberry muffin.  Those were fun to try out.<br /><br />This is a great gift and the jelly beans were fresh and flavorful.  If you love jelly beans, you can't go wrong here.

### OK Coffee - Wasteful, Escessive Packaging
I found the coffee in a single serving pod to be pretty weak for an 8 oz cup.  Since I don't have this style of coffee maker, I opened the pods and poured them directly into the coffee filters I normally use to make coffee.  Two packages makes a pretty tasty, full bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />My biggest concern with this product was the incredible amount of packaging for very little product.  15 small pouches of coffee, wrapped up like tea bags, each one individually packaged in a foil packet which are all placed in a fairly large box.  The box is wonderfully designed with multi-colored, foil embossed design (it would probably make a great gift for your favorite Bob Marley fan), but the amount of packaging is unbelievably excessive for, maybe, six or seven ounces of coffee.  The elaborate declarations of "fair trade," "ethical treatment of farm workers," "biodiversity" and "sustainable cultivation" (among other first world catchphrases) ring hollow for me.  This all may be true but it's hard not to be cynical and slightly suspicious of the true motivations for the lofty rhetoric on the box.<br /><br />The company's declaration of "we believe that pure food from the earth is physically and spiritually beneficial," sounds absurd when compared to the amount of waste in the packaging of their product.  How pure can it really be after it has gone through this much processing?

### Cereal
This cereal is the best of the bunch of grain cereals of those I've tried, so I buy a lot of it.  It's not at all unusual for me to eat this cereal three times a day, along with other nutritious food.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I am not allowed to purchase as much as I wish so I have to make frequent smaller purchases.<br /><br />I almost always have it in the morning, limited only by running out of milk; although I occasionally eat it without milk.  I add a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon and water at a 3:1 (water:cereal) ratio, zap it on high for 90 seconds, let it sit for as long as it takes to finish my coffee while I read a few chapters from the Bible, and then finish with another 60 seconds to reach my preferred consistency and temperature.  To this I immediately add a very generous cup of walnuts and then cover with milk.  Pecans are better than walnuts when you can find good pecans, but that's a rarity here in North Carolina.  The very best pecans are grown in or near Hoover, Alabama by local folks and sold to local folks and not generally available elsewhere.  Eating a bowl of this cereal with a generous helping of Alabama pecans can make you feel like a very special and privileged person.

### Not great matcha, but for the price it's good for everyday use
It tastes good enough and is affordable enough to use every day. It's not sweet and super bright, almost-neon green like medium and high grade matcha, but it's not bitter, unpleasant, stale, and brownish like Malden's similarly priced matcha. It is only slightly more expensive than Malden's matcha ($3.40/oz. or $2.62/oz. in bulk vs. Malden's $2.50/oz) but the quality is superior. I highly recommend this as an overall good mathca at a really good price.<br /><br />If this is the first matcha you try you won't be disappointed. But if you're not impressed with the taste keep in mind that the next step up in quality available through Amazon is at around $10/oz (ex. DoMatcha's 2nd Harvest).

I ordered 2 "double 4 pounds bags" expecting to receive 16 pounds of salt.  I received two 4 pound (8# total) packages.  Their excuse was: We said it was 4 pounds. Personally, I think they have made this confusing on purpose to gain more business.  I still don't know what they mean by "double bag."

### Love the quality, but the packaging does not promote freshness
My comment regarding freshness in the title is about how fast you and your family consume the couscous in each box. I live alone, but since couscous is a staple of my diet, the packaging is not an issue.<br /><br />If you occasionally eat couscous I recommend, instead, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011T2ZJS">Marakesh Express Couscous Plain Can, 25.2-Ounce Can(Pack of 6)</a>. The quality of the couscous is on par with this one, and the packaging is of a superior design that allows you to keep it fresh for longer periods.<br /><br />What I like about this, the Marrakesh brand and my other favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDP5TI">Vigo Couscous, 10-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> is each are consistent in preparation. What I mean by that is if you follow the instructions to the letter each serving of couscous is going to be identical to past ones. I have used brands that I will not name that are not as consistent or as repeatable when preparing it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this brand for those who consume couscous regularly (2-3 or more times per week.)

### Love them... New Staple
My wife and I are runners and all around athletes. I bought these after seeing Ryan Hall rave about them on his blog. Here are a few thoughts.<br /><br />They may seem expensive, but what I found is that they are so filling, we don't have to eat much. We make 3 servings per meal (I usually eat 2 and my wife 1). This is 1 cup which is about a 1/7 of the box. That meal ends up being about $0.75 for the two of us! Also, most pancakes usually have tons of calories, I can eat two servings, be comfortably full and only have eaten 260 calories. That's amazing!<br /><br />They are very quick to make. We have only made pancakes so far, but it only takes about 20 seconds of whisking. How easy is that?<br /><br />As for taste, I'm not AMAZED but they are good. They are boarder-line bland, so I put a little butter spray on them. We often mix them with fruit. However, for wholegrain... I'd say they are excellent. We've started mixing in protein powder and that has the potential to improve the taste depending on the protein you use.<br /><br />Healthy, cheap, easy, tasty, hearty... what more do you want?

### Excellent Quality - Flavor on the Weak Side
I'm on my third 5 pound bag of this CO2 Decaf Colombian coffee.  I obviously have enjoyed it.  The aroma and freshness of the coffee from Coffee Bean Direct is absolutely wonderful.  For some reason the beans also grind terrifically without any static electricity that usually sends other grounds scattering.  I like that.  However, after buying my third bag of the Colombian beans I think I will move on to another decaf.<br /><br />I don't know whether the Co2 process yields a weaker flavor or if it is just this particular roast.  I have found that a normal portion of ground beans in a drip coffee maker produces a rather watery and weak coffee, not nearly worthy of the amazing smell of the beans.  I keep using more and more coffee to get the most flavor out of the beans.  This seems to work ok for now, but I now use almost 50% more coffee than is normally called for.  I still like the brand though and look forward to trying another CO2 decaf roast from them next time.

### Kid tested, husband approved!
First I have to say that the reviews here have been helpful in understanding how to make this milk powder delicious. The trick to lump free milk is too let it sit over night. I use a recycled glass jug that once held organic juice. add the powder first to the jar, 3 tablespoons for each 8oz of water (more if you like it a little creamier) then add the water. Make sure your container will hold the powder plus water with enough room to shake it up. Put the lid on tight and shake shake shake!<br />Leave in the fridge overnight, and shake before using. No lumps, no problem! Use within 3 days after mixing. This came in handy during all the winter storms we had and were snowed in. Didn't have to put up with the rush on milk, we had the ability to "make our own" as needed.<br /><br />We love to have this on hand when we are running low on milk. In cereal, the kids can't tell the difference. My husband and I can drink it as we would any other skim milk. He was pleasantly surprised at how good it tastes.

### My dogs love it
I love this product but the vegetable pieces are a little too big for my dogs to digest.<br /><br />Every time I get a new bag of Sojos Grain Free (previously "Europa") I grind up the whole bag using my spice grinder.  This makes it easier for them to digest and I don't have pieces of bright orange carrot in their poo anymore.<br /><br />When I grind it up like this it also hydrates much more quickly, which is important. If it's not properly hydrated, the dog can get constipated.<br /><br />I always feed this with raw meats such as chicken, beef, or lamb.  I sometimes add it to cooked fish or scrambled eggs, but I don't do this more than once a week.  Also, I add a little bit of organ meat a few times a week.  You should use organic liver because this is where the toxins build up.<br /><br />To make it less expensive, I get chicken necks and trim meat.<br /><br />I hope this helps!

### This works so fast!
Bought this for my little 15 year old Pekingnese with leg problems.  After just 3 weeks he is again able to go for longer walks and has even gone up and done to the second floor.  I use glucosamine MSM myself and thought when Fred was having problems why not try something for dogs.<br /><br />This is just the best.  If your pets are having leg issues  I would give this a try.  So much better than pills to try to get them to take.  I simply add to his food 2 x a day.  Must be flavorless...Fred is a bit picky and never even balk at this.  Good luck...give it a try...great stuff!

### We Love Altoids!!!
We love these ginger Altoids!  While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our tea and sometimes, coffee.  One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting!  Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee.  And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.  Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative.  Almost no calories, but big on flavor!  We've used these for decades!

### My greyhounds love teenie greenies
I have two 60-65 lb greyhounds and I buy the Teenie sized greenies as a snack twice a day.  I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed.  I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it.  Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.  Another reason why I like the teenie size is becacause they can be rationed out to last longer rather than getting the "large or X-Lg" greenie where you get fewer pieces.

### On the light side
The caramel vanilla cream flavoring of K-cup by Green Mountain is a tasty option of the LIGHT roast category.  It's suitable for my tastes because I don't put but a dash of milk in my coffee.  If you drink with sugar and cream I suspect the flavor will be lost.  Smells great while brewing but then again they pretty much all do!  Green mountain is one of my favorite brands and this flavor is good but not great.  I might order it again.

### Kind of pointless, and creme layers are single, not double.
When I first heard about these cookies, I imagined they would be essentially be a sextuple-stuffed oreo.  Excessive, but why not?  They I saw the photo with the three cookie layers and two creme layers, so I revised a little and expected a quadruple-stuffed cookie, with a chocolate layer and a vanilla layer.<br /><br />But no.  This is three cookie layers, and two single creme layers.<br /><br />Is it an okay tasting cookie?  Sure.  Would I buy it again?  No.  Regular or double-stuffed Oreo's are both superior.<br /><br />Nabisco, you have missed an opportunity here.  People want more and thicker creme layers!  This cookie is far too healthy compared with what I want.<br /><br />Clog my arteries or give me death!

### If you like your Newtons crispy...
I brought these Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey into my office to share with my colleagues during an afternoon break.<br /><br />The first thing we noticed is the lovely cinnamon-and-cookie smell when you open the package. These sweet mild cookies with tiny bits of fig call out for a cold glass of milk or a good cup of tea.  I prefer the older fruity-Newtons, but these are a really good alternative for crunchy cookie fans, mixed cookie plates, or those looking for a less fruity Newton that still has plenty of sweet, cinnamon, cookie goodness.

### Surprisingly Good, Surprisingly Effective
My throat was killing me today, and on and off this week.  I decided to make myself some tea despite the heat and sort through my old tea collection to cull some teas that the food pantry can use up better than I can.<br /><br />The Yogi cold sampler nearly went straight into the food bank box until I saw "Throat Comfort."  I scanned the ingredients and liked what I saw:  all recognizable and nothing that I'm aware of being an allergy risk for me.  (eg, no lemon grass . . . though companies can change their ingredients, so check the label on your box!)<br /><br />The relief was immediate.  I made a little surprised, happy noise at the first sip.  The pain relief doesn't last long between sips, but oh my, this feels good on a sore throat!<br /><br />This tea has an almost artificially sweet aftertaste to me, though there are no ingredients I recognize as sweeteners on the box.  It's probably the organic fennel seeds and organic licorice root, which are the top two ingredients.  I have strongly mixed feelings about licorice and will skip black jellybeans, but I always liked fennel.  This tea is delicious, and maybe a little too sweet or anise-y to take seriously as a regular daily tea, but for a sore throat it's heaven.<br /><br />I wonder which ingredients get the job done, as I have to confess I'm now a full believer in the product.  I drink green tea almost every day at work, and it's wonderful stuff but didn't help my throat like this did.

### Try it with baked salmon
The lime & chili flavor is a natural for salmon; salmon is often served with a slice of lemon to offset the oily fish, and although not typically served with salmon, the chili is a particularly complementary spice. Who knew? It is a great way to get kids to eat the salmon that is being served to the rest of the family. (I have not tried it on other fish yet.)

### Excellent dog food
We have two collies, one 11 year old and one 3 1/2 years.  We have to watch what we feed our senior, because he has a sensitive digestive system.  We also have to watch the 3 1/2 year old because she has pancreatitis and a low fat food is good for her so that she keeps an even weight.  We tried many different dog foods including premium holistic foods and prescription foods.  We have used the Wellness Super5Mix Healthy Weight food for about 2 months.  So far, both of them seem to be doing well.  They like it well enough that we use the dry kibbles for their treats.  I will update the review in another few months.

When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this.

### Just Trust Them
While they have a few mustards to choose from I picked this one solely as a dare, to the Fallot people, to disappoint me.  I've had their Dijon and their Dijon with Peppercorn so I knew that they knew what they were doing.  When I saw the Gingerbread variant I figured it was the LEAST appealing.  For me that is always a sign of a way to expand my horizons so I went for it.  It is excellent.  The more detailed ingredients include wheat and spices.  It's not the gingerbread taste I was expecting, which is a good thing.  It is dijon with a very unique zip to it.  I put it on ham with a whole grain wheat bread.  I prefer high tech ingredients like Boar's Head rosemary & sundried tomato ham but it's too delicate for this particular mustard so just use a basic high quality meat.  Serve it to yourself though, unless you know someone who is a total "foodie."  I paired it(LOL) with a French beverage in the form of a Citadelle gin martini.  Look to the French for food and art and you won't be disappointed,

### Looks like good stuff!
The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

### The best gluten-free bread!
This is the best GF bread I've ever eaten!  The mix is easy to use, with very clear instructions.  It does take a little time from start to finish, because it's yeast-risen bread.  But the results are worth it.  I have tried several mixes and recipes, and most of them either have a weird taste or crumbly texture.  This bread has a wonderful texture (like "real" bread) and tastes great.  One tip (this is also on the box) is that if your loaf lasts more than 2-3 days, slice it and store it in the freezer.  It will stay fresher that way.  Otherwise, it will become a little stale sitting on the counter. But even if it's a little on the stale side, it makes great toast!<br /><br />Stephanie<br />Indianapolis, IN

Pistachios by Wonderful are gluten-free and heart healthy.  I've tried pistachios of another brand and the fresh ones in the store.  These are hands down the best in taste and quality.  The nuts are all big and always fresh.  They are flavored the just right amount, roasted with no added oil, and sea salted.  A good source of Vitamin B6, copper and manganese, these nuts are worth buying.  The serving size is generous but also accurate considering how they're hard to put down.  160 calories per serving and a serving is 49 nuts.  This 16-oz. bag has about 8 servings in it.  Recommended.

### I use it daily
I love Nutiva hemp protein powder. I use it every morning in my green smoothies. It tastes better than most protein powders, but you may wish to add some mint, cacao powder, lime juice or other citrus to mask the green taste if you are not fond of it. It is very mind and pleasant to me, but it doesn't taste like the processed, flavored protein powders some may be used to. I usually have difficulty digesting protein powders, but I don't have any gas, bloating or tummy aches with this product.  The powder is smooth and blends very nicely with no lumps. It's not grainy and doesn't make me gag like many processed protein powders. I love that it's vegan, sustainable, and ethically produced. I subscribed to this product so I never run out. I keep a freezer bag of it in the freezer and a 32 oz mason jar of it in the fridge. It's dry so you don't have to defrost it or anything to use. You can also store at room temperature, but I prefer to keep mine cold. I also use nutiva coconut oil, cacao powder, and hemp seeds on a regular basis. They are all excellent products that I highly recommend.
