This is a great conditioner if you are looking for softness but it does not give my hair shine and it doesn't work well to use a conditioner styler for Natural Hair.

### good product
I wanted a sugar, artificial color, and aspartame free gum. Spry provided. I'm a heavy chewer and buying gum in blister packs costs a fortune so I was happy to find a gum that came in bulk. The flavor is a nice fruity one, but it does fade fast, which doesn't really bother me that much. My biggest issue is the texture. I ordered both the fresh fruit and the green tea flavor (really does taste like sweet tea, for a little while). I'll chew a piece of gum for ages so long as it doesn't loose texture. The green tea flavor keeps texture well, the fresh fruit flavor gets soft and slimy fairly fast.

### Really good!  Hard to believe it is "light"
I love this dressing.  The problem I have found with lots of "light" dressings is that they taste too watered down and are lacking in body.  This stuff is delicious!  I tried it over just a plain salad of greens, tomato and some colby-jack and it was delicious.  Can't wait to use it on my chicken salads.  It tastes like a vinaigrette but with just enough sweetness.  I also love that it doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup. I compared the label on this to lots of other brands and this one was the only one that didn't contain HFCS or red dye.  I did not have the experience the other reviewer did, I think they got a bad bottle.  I personally love this stuff.

### Love tastybite, but this is twice what it costs in healthfood stores.
I love tasty bite, but I've never ever seen it go for more than $4 a pouch and that was in a remote location, super price inflated mountain town grocery store. Generally I get them 2 for $5 at whole foods or trader joes (it's in a TJ's package there, but it's still tasty bite). A pack of 6 for $30 is $5 each! Might as well go out for Indian food at that price.

I've tried another of these Mocktails and didn't like it but this one is great!  I'm diabetic and I don't like most Crystal Light drink flavors but this one is perfectly sweet, not overly.  I've never had an alcoholic Margarita so I can't compare but the flavor of this is great!  Even my kids like it.  I'd definitely buy this again.  Can't wait til they sell this in our local store but for now I'll just have to buy it here, price is probably better anyway.

### ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~
When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all.

### Pretty good, needs improvement
I only buy organic, and decided to try a case based on the positive reviews. Here is my take on the soup:<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1. Good ingredients: organic vegies, no MSG, no hydrogenated oil or chemicals<br />2. Good amount of vegetables (unlike many soups that are mostly broth)<br />3. Low in salt, fat-free (you can add either, but can't take it away)<br /><br />The cons:<br />1. Mushy overcooked veggies<br />2. Not much seasoning<br />3. No pop-top on the can (a minor gripe, but really I can't remember the last time I had to use a can opener for soup, making this soup less of an option to take to work)<br /><br />Here is what I did to take this basic soup up a notch: added a bit of organic olive oil, a little oregano, and a dash of cayenne. This makes the soup much tastier. Sometimes I add shredded cheddar or Parmesan cheese.<br />Still, I can't fix the mushy veggies. It isn't enough of a convenience, with no pop-top and the doctoring required, so I'll stick to making my own with canned organic seasoned tomatoes, organic broth, and mixed veggies. Better soup, easy to make, more economical. Sorry Amy.

### S Flynn (New Mexico, USA)
I love this product for it's taste and nutritional benefits. Since I eat it almost every morning, I usually cook up 4 servings at a time. Four cups water, 1 cup McCann's Steelcut Oatmeal, 1/4 cup Cranraisins, 1/4 golden raisins. I cook it for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. I then pour it into a square pyrex dish, cover, refrigerate.  When it is fully cold, I cut it into 4 section.  Each morning, I'm able to pull out one section, chop it up a bit, add Vanilla Soy Milk, and microwave for 2 minutes (depending on microwave power). Before eating I add 1/4 cup raw oatbran, a dash of cinnamon and enjoy. I highly recommend McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal.

### My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!
My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled. It seems like he enjoys juicy textured food in his mouth. He is primarily on wet food because of his stomititis. I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

### Find these in a store to try first and they only contain 10% juice
I bought these without trying first because the price was at a 50% discount and I didn't want to miss the low price.<br />After trying one I really wish I would have waited and tried to find a single to taste first, now I have 31 of these left and don't see them moving out of the box very fast, if at all. My 6 year old also tried it, and I was really hoping he would like it because he's who I bought them for, but he was less than thrilled, so I'm pretty sure he won't be running to get one.<br />I would say that these would probably be best if a child has never had sugar ever, or very little, and doesn't know the difference in taste.

### Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard
I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I "transitioned" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of "transitioning" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.

### Delicious Sauce
On a pure taste basis, this sauce gets 5 stars. (I am not going to address the nutritional aspect. Read the nutritional label and you can see that this is not "clean eating" or health food. But if you want healthy food, you're probably not reaching for something that says Taco Bell, anyway.)<br /><br />I love spicy food, and I found that this sauce has a nice zip to it. For sensitive tongues, it may even be too spicy if too much is used. It's nice and creamy with that smokey chipotle flavor coming through the spice.<br /><br />This sauce works well on tacos, sandwiches (although a bit runny), and nachos or layered taco dips.

### Hooray for the Treat Ball!
My sister's youngest son had a pacifier which was nicknamed "Pluggy", which would keep him content for long stretches of time - and this is the doggy equivalent.<br /><br />I have a 17 pound Bedlington Terrier, for whom I purchased a Medium sized Everlasting Treat Ball, and we _both_ love it.  The "everlasting" treats that come with the ball were okay, but when they were in the ball she would lose interest because they were just too difficult to make any headway on, and when they were outside the ball she'd just chew them up in a matter of minutes.<br /><br />The real fun is putting small treats inside it (I use Charlee Bear brand turkey liver and cranberry treats which are about the size of a lima bean) and watching her go.<br /><br />There are several ways to get at them, she's discovered - rolling by poking it with her nose will sometimes yield results - smacking it with her paw is also sometimes lucky - and squeezing it with her jaws, which she can _barely_ do.  I think this is the secret - if she had a small she would be _too_ successful, and that would take the challenge out of it.<br /><br />I've had this for over a year, and it has sustained pretty much no damage, although shoes, electronics, socks and other items around our house had been completely destroyed before its arrival.  She can carry it sideways by biting on the flat part - the only problem is that we spend a lot of time looking for it when it gets hidden under things.  She knows the phrase Treat Ball by heart - and will usually go find it when asked - in order to get a refill - except when it has gotten into somewhere she is afraid or unable to go.  I'm buying another one so hopefully we can cut our hunting time in half.<br /><br />TREAT BALL RULES!

### Killer chicken and salmon every time
I used to buy this great sauce at Costco but don't have one close by any more, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. It does a brilliant job on slab salmon fillets, whether you use it as a pre- marinade (a half hour before you cook) or a cooking sauce. You don't need to use too much, either. Marinate skinless boneless chicken breasts for a few hours and grill, pan-fry (non-stick pan) partially covered, or oven bake. Fantastic taste, juicy, and gets better in the fridge!! The taste is very slightly Asian, but not unfriendly to any other food tastes you want to pair it with.

I am extremely dissatisfied with the product and customer service from this company (Barry Farm). It says on the page for this product "Usually ships within 6 to 10 days". I ordered this product over three and a half weeks ago and just received it. I was still charged over $8.00 for shipping (more than the item was worth). I took precautions for the product not to sit in the sun and melt, ordering it so it would be delivered on a day I was home. This effort failed; the shipping and delivery dates changed...twice. I got an email from Amazon stating that they had not received notification of shipping from the seller (Barry Farm). I emailed the seller, received no response. I then got an email from Amazon a day later with a delivery time frame. The product did not arrive during the stated time frame (late). When it finally arrived, I received a bag of melted goo. But the interesting thing was, it was evident that the product had melted before, re-hardened, and then began to melt again in my mailbox. Due care was not taken to package the product in a manner that MAY have helped prevent such damage. I will not be ordering from this company again.

### Such a pleasant tasting surprise
I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and started to follow a gluten-free diet.  Before I was diagnosed I took great joy in baking healthy whole-grain treats frugally from scratch and loved the nutty fullness that my breads and treats had.<br /><br />Once I cut out the gluten I continued to enjoy some of the other grains out there, like rice, quinoa, corn, and millet.  I have missed bread and pancakes, especially, however, as those were key parts to some of my favorite breakfasts.  At a recommendation I picked up a packet of this mix to try, skeptical of the gummy or crumbly nasty tasting pancakes I might have to be drenching with syrup just to swallow.<br /><br />As we mixed up the pancakes according to directions, I could tell that this was going to be something special.  It had little flecks from the almond meal that pleasantly reminded me of some of my successful whole grain pancakes (not tough dense things that some people consider food).  The texture was smooth and silky.  As they cooked, there was not the slimy looking top that the previously gummy pancakes had.  They were a little different from wheat pancakes, but still looked amazingly good.  There was very nice browning on the bottom after we flipped them over.  When they were done, they looked like pancakes.  REAL pancakes.<br /><br />Topped with a bit of maple syrup, these were such a treat for my poor abused tastebuds.  A fluffy texture, a fine grain, not a trace of gummyness to be found - I was in heaven.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned, my search for a gluten-free baking mix stops here.  I have no desire at this point in my life (full-time student, wife and mom to a toddler) to relearn how to bake my favorite foods.  This mix is a great value, easy and so delicious - not to mention it is nutritious - that I am happy to save a place in my pantry for it.<br /><br />Thanks, Pamela's, for such a great product, and to Amazon for carrying it at such a great value.

### Healthy Food For Our Feline Friends
When my parents first got their cat, they tried every cat food brand - dry or wet - it didn't matter, their cat would not eat more than a few bites.  Then they discovered The Goodlife.  That is all their pampered cat eats.<br /><br />A few years ago, when I adopted my lil feline buddy from the shelter, I wanted the best for her.  I tried the expensive, all-protein brands, but my cat would have various stomach issues.  I finally switched her over to The Goodlife and again, voila!  For the past 2 years, that is all she ever eats (plus her treats).<br /><br />Currently, I also am a caretaker for a feral cat colony in my condo complex and feed them a combination of the store brand stuff and The Goodlife.

### Pod Brewing - Bleh;  LOOSE Brewing FANTASTIC
I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.

the packs are definitely not that easy to use, big and bulky, they could have cut it down A LOT and been just fine.<br /><br />the popcorn is GOOD, good quality. most of the kernels pop and are very tasty.  the oil is ok, not quite theater quality, but not bad, the salt, however, is a different story all together.  i does not taste good, NOT good at all.  if you use the whole portion it is FAR too salty, and definitely does not taste like theater popcorn, in fact the first batch i made i was so disappointed i thought i should have just kept buying microwaveable.<br /><br />however I've been playing and experimenting, as i don't ant to waste a whole $25.  i definitely like using all of the kernals and oil, and about 3/4th of the salt, it seems pretty good this way.<br /><br />i will buy a different brand next time, or just buy a whole box of salt directly from the theater and substitute that salt for this, however it is convenient and not too bad after you figure out the perfect recipe for you and your family.

### I bought 14 cases of Orgain....
Was looking for an organic, pre-made protein shake.  Years of drinking my own concoctions left much to be desired.<br /><br />I stumbled across Orgain at Whole Foods; bought 1 of chocolate and 1 of vanilla, was instantly hooked.  I then went to Amazon and was able to buy them for &lt; $2/container, which is the cheapest price anywhere!  Did I mention I purchased 14 cases worth?  That should tell you how much I love Orgain.  Too bad Amazon doesn't offer the iced mocha flavor for Prime shipping and subscribe & save.

Wow - I am totally addicted to these.  In my opinion, they BBQ flavoring is really good and these are very crunchy.  It does not taste like these should be healthy for you.  I would rather eat these BBQ chips than any other chips and I love all kinds of chips.  I have now switch over to POPCHIPS as I know I am eating a better chip and its healther too.  For 100 calories and around 3 grams of fat, I feel it is a good choice and the taste makes it worth wild.  I have taken some of these to work and have gotten some co-workers hooked on these as well.

### Avoid, a horrible green tea
I have been drinking tea for years. This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had. Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it, but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth, sweet, and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces. I love the taste of a solid green tea, however this is anything but. I don't know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white, but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved. The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing, NOTHING but bitter grass. I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks, I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others, but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume. This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough.

The original gummy worm. This last package, which I take to work to share was borderline stale. They were leathery and had molding debris stuck on bunches of them. I remember when your worms never had warts, these had lots and should have been rejected. I think I'm gonna stop buying this brand.<br /><br />I have seen on TV how these are made which explains why they are so expensive. The white warts that get stuck to them I believe is from molding debris, based on the TV program (How It's Made, season 1). Usually these are top notch but lately they are B- or C- grade.

Excellent product! It's become a kitchen staple--supplements stir-fry dishes, meats, eggs, pasta sauces, salads --with not overly-pungent garlic flavor.

### A Visit to the Peppermint Room
Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon.

### Really Gross
I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as "coffee tasting" or with "roasted flavors," but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this "roasted" flavor.

### Simply the best way to eliminate eggs from baking.
I have been using this product religiously for the past decade, after becoming a vegan and experimenting with flax seed goop, pureed silken tofu, mashed bananas--all of the egg replacement staples.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why so many vegans dislike this product.  It's always turned out perfect baked goods for me, in both taste and texture, is inexpensive, and doesn't lend the icky flavor of flax or silken tofu to your baked goods. It's just neutral, and helps the baked good bind and rise, as egg would.  I've made everything from brownies to decadent cakes to cookies to muffins to airy fluffy biscuits with this, and it's all been highly praised (often without realizing the goods are vegan) by omnivore, egg-eating relatives and friends who have begged me for years to open my own bakery.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the general complaints I hear all too frequently are about.  As I hope I've made clear, this product works perfectly for me.  Here are some of my tips for using this product: 1) use a liquid that's already in the recipe (eg soymilk) to blend your powder. 2) always always ALWAYS do your best to get all of the lumps out of your liquid+powder mixture.  I blend mine in a small bowl or ramekin (depending how much Ener-G Egg Replacer I'm using) with a fork or tiny single egg beater.  If the mixture still has tons of lumps, it's not going to do its job.  But when it doesn't have lumps, it works perfectly!  3) I always use about one egg's worth more of Ener-G than the recipe calls for. Just to be safe.  4) Consider adding about a half tablespoon per egg replaced of oil to make up for the lost fat content.<br /><br />Good luck, and please give this product a try!  It's truly excellent.

They used to run to mealtimes but that basically ended with this food and it was like pulling teeth to get one of them to eat at all.  I was not a fan either--the food basically crumbled to dust, and who wants to eat powder? I switched them to the Wellness salmon-based food and they LOVE that.

### these chocolates are one of the best I've ever had, andI'm  from Europe!!
I am used to GOOD quality chocolate, with a strong bite, and creamy smooth snap, underlying tones of lemon and bitterness in dark chocolate. Let me tell you right now, these chocolates are very very good.<br />They are slightly heavy on the bitterness if anything- all the better for me. I've had those other dark chocolates ( sugar free and non sugar free) from American made brands, and they are all awful. DOve sugar free are creamy in texture but with enough bite to feel like you're chewing something, which yelids to a smooth bittersweet creamy consistency. And the chocolate flesh IS consistently smooth- unlike other brands which resemble crumbles in your mouth.<br />The melty interior is so good at first I wasn't aware it's actually an almost=ganache interior, ever so slightly softer than the shell, but not enough to be a soft centre chocolate.<br />This centre makes them perfect to "eat" as opposed to just put in your mouth and let them melt, like a soft centred chocolate would do  ( I'm thinking of a liquidy centre like soft caramel or mint cream, which actually flows out).<br /><br />These chocolates are way better than the peanut butter filled ones too- for some reason, those ones don't pack the dark chocolate punch at all, and the peanut butter inside is not very peanutty or buttery. You can eat a whole packet before finding any peanut taste at all- those ones are totally disappointing.<br />THese dark chocolate truffle chocolates are really good. I'm ashamed and proud of myself for buying a load of them on sale, and I won't be sharing them!

### A touch disappointed
I've been eating some of the BetterOats oatmeal options for the last several months.  When browsing on Amazon one day, I found that such a thing as chocolate oatmeal existed.  My heart nearly stopped.  How could it be that I had never heard of such glory?  BetterOats makes some delicious oatmeal options, however, after finally tasting this product, I can say that the the dark chocolate oatmeal is good but not great. If I had been unable to find this in a local grocery and I knew what it tasted like, there would be no way that I would purchase it for 13 to 17 dollars (as most Amazon vendors are commanding) for three boxes.  Some things to consider:<br /><br />1) Finding the product:  If you are flirting with the idea of buying this stuff online, I will say I was in the same boat.  I was tempted about three times to purchase it from vendors commanding quite a premium.  I held out hope I would find it for less and finally I did.  Meijer sells a box of five packets for 1.99 (look in the hot cereal section).<br /><br />2) The consistency of the product:  One thing I love about BetterOats is that all oatmeal products are packaged in a bag that has a fill line. The user uses the bag as a device to determine how much water is needed for the oatmeal. I'm one of those folks that always uses too little water, which leads to a gluey, unsatisfying mess. If you use the bag to measure the water you need, your oatmeal will never be dry or soupy.<br /><br />3) The flavor:  It's good.  It's not overly sweet and definitely not bitter.  I guess I expected more chocolate morsels, which a person could definitely add on their own.  It simply was not as decadent as I had hoped for.  I actually prefer the company's chai or peaches and cream options, which have relatively vibrant flavor profiles.<br /><br />4) The nutrition:  The calorie content surprised me in a good way.  A lot of the BetterOats options have 160 calories per bag.  The chocolate oatmeal also has 160 calories.  The ingredients are predictable for a chocolate oatmeal.  The first ingredient is whole grain rolled oats and the second is sugar.<br /><br />5) Power to satisfy:  I did not find this oatmeal to be as filling as other options offered by this company.  It really only held me over for two hours.  The company's other options usually get me through three - four hours.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic whole grain rolled oats, sugar, chocoalte chips (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, vanilla), cocoa, flaxseed, salt, natural flavor, guar gum.

### Not so great
The primary problem with this food is it's high concentration of corn--cats are meat eaters and ideally most of their food should be meat. This food substitutes corn as a filler. Over half of this product is most likely corn filler. This is pretty standard for cat food at this price level. They also use the less preferred method of safety testing their product. The best thing is to do actual feed tests where in a laboratory they feed cats the food and see if it's nutritionally adequate or if it kills them. Instead this product is chemically analyzed in a laboratory and certified "safe" that way. This testing is inadequate and results in death for many people's pets. No evaluation is made of whether the food is digestible or not, if it is contaminated with poisons, toxins, or heavy metals. Chances are this food won't kill your cat, but since they stopped feed testing, there's no way to know if future batches are safe.<br /><br />The nicest things I can say:<br />The high filler means it firms up runny stools moderately well.<br />It's somewhat better nutritionally than most generic grocery store brands

### Homesteading your own, a must have.
I ordered this filter after using cheese cloth and other methods of making my syrup clear and free of debris. I didn't want to spend any money on a product that won't help me be self sufficient. So I bought it, and I was amazed by it with my first small 2 quart batch. So I washed it in the washer, bad idea, it held onto some soap and my next batch tasted soapy. So I suggest always wash this by hand, and don't use soap every time. Be sure to clean it out very good as it will hold old debris if not cleaned well. It does hold onto a cup or more of syrup, I dip it back into the next batch of syrup gently to transfer some of the old syrup sugar back into the new batch. DO NOT REVERSE it or turn it inside out to do this. Gently dip it in... Glad I made this purchase, it has helped me make a great end product. Modern Pioneer

What can I say? This dog food is one of the best, among the relatively short list of dog foods on dogfoodanalysis.com receiving their maximum rating of 6 stars. The ingredients are top tier and carefully chosen with your dog's well-being in mind. And apparently it's also delicious, because my dog LOVES it! When I set her food bowl down, she drools on the floor if I wait even just a few seconds to tell her she can eat. She had never ever done this before, and she started doing it the day I started mixing it into her food and has done it since.<br /><br />Plus, it's great for her. I'm not even halfway through this bag and already her coat is improving! I transitioned slowly from her old food and she has had no negative reactions to it whatsoever. If your dog tolerates this food (all dogs are different of course), you can be confident they will thrive on it. Oh and lastly, Wellness is more readily available than most other holistic grain-free foods, which is very convenient--I buy mine at Petco.
