### Delicious
These drops taste so much better than any conventional type of hard candy (Lifesavers, those European kinds with the pretty wrappings) it almost seems an insult to compare them. YE's assorted fruit drops are a staple in my cupboard for when I want to satisfy my sweet tooth with something small. Each flavor actually tastes just like the particular fruit it's supposed to taste like (Mango, blood orange, strawberry, etc), and quite powerfully so.

### Absolutely delicious tea!
I love this tea.  Ahmad tea is just a perfect cup of tea.  English Tea No. 1 is my tea of choice.  It's perfectly balanced and never bitter, no matter how long it's brewed.<br /><br />Incidentally, if you want to purchase English Tea No. 1 in it's loose form, you have to buy "English Afternoon Tea" loose.  Please note, however, that in teabag form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are two distinct blends.  But in loose form, English Afternoon and English Tea No.1 are on in the same. I don't know why that's the case, but that's what a representative from Ahmad Tea told me when I emailed them to ask where I can buy English Tea No. 1 in loose form.<br /><br />I purchased loose English Afteroon Tea (aka Eng. Tea No. 1) from another online purveyor, and the loose version of the tea is just as delicious (maybe even more so) than the bagged version.  the loose tea is whole leaf tea, which is hard to find in a black tea.  usually, loose black tea is very finely shredded, not altogether different from its bagged form.  but the loose Ahmad black tea is whole leaf, which just goes to show how high the quality is at Ahmad tea.<br /><br />all in all, a terrific tea, and highly recommended.

### These rolled oats are ok, but get gummy when cooked.
These oats are rolled, but they are thin, resulting in a creamy bowl of hot cereal. If you like a heartier oat, that keeps its shape, and is more "flaky" when cooked, then try Mother's Thick Rolled Oats: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ8B0">Mother's Rolled Oats, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> We like the taste and texture of the thick oats, and they can easily be made into "quick" oats for recipies with one or two pulses in the food processor - so they are a more versatile oat. They also make chewier oatmeal cookies and a very nice garnish on top of homemade breads or muffins. Try Vermont pure maple syrup on these hearty oats for a real treat! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248A9HU">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Syrup, Grade A Medium Amber, 1 Pint Jug</a>

I wanted to try buckwheat noodles for a while, and finally found these at the store.  We tried them in a stir fry and it worked out great.  They do seem a little salty, and apparently that is just how they are based on another review, so be careful adding salt to the water when cooking.  We use them in a beef and pepper stir fry with a homemade sauce and they are a perfect match.<br /><br />We use one package, 1 lb beef, 2 peppers, 2 onions and that makes 4 dinner servings to give you an idea of how much is in one pack.  Cook as directed and add them in at the end of the cooking to heat through.

### Bad Shipping
Pero is an excellent substitute for coffee.  My father has been drinking it for years.  The product is awesome, however, when he received the package, 4 out of 6 canisters were broken open during shipping.  He is elderly, 88 years of age, and to him it was to much of an inconvience to repackage everything and return them to the post office and ship them back so he obsorbed the loss.  That was disheartening for me since I live several hours away and could not be there to help.  Product good shipping was very bad.

Unless there's a reason to drink this expensive water, I'd rather stick with normal spring water.<br /><br />This water tastes pure but the price is a bit high for daily use.

this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

### Not bad. Price increase since then
I like the fact that the cans are BPA free, the fish  troll or pole caught,  and are smaller with lower mercury.  The first can seemed a bit strong tasting and salty (I'm supposed to be low sodium).  The second time around I used a bit more mayo, added some fresh coriander, lemon juice and pepper and it tasted better.  It's only cooked once, in the can (with no water added), but it is made from tuna that has been frozen.  Don't know if that is common in the industry or not.<br />Since I ordered in June it seems the price went up about $.58 a can on the subscription plan.

### Wonderful!
Switched to this because I wasn't happy with the way my dog was on the Purina ProPlan Selects. (Or the purina one naturals before that.) It was time to get off the purina!<br /><br />Couldn't ask for better ingredients-- love having the variety of protein sources, all of them "real meat." I chose it because it didn't have just one  meat in it. With the varied protein sources, there's less of a chance of your dog developing food allergies. Since my dog has slight seasonal allergies, last thing I want to risk is her developing food allergies. She scratched all last summer, and I'm hoping this summer will be different. It's all natural, which is a plus in my book, and my dog absolutely loves it!.<br /><br />I've only been feeding this for a couple weeks now, and I've already noticed that my dog has to eat less to be full, and she has lots of energy (Oh no, more energy!)<br /><br />My dog's about 25 pounds, and I feed the regular sized kibble-- they aren't that big at all, and they're a "flat" shape, which I thought was unusual. I'd think the small bites would be for a 10 pound dog. I'd worry about any dog that was much bigger swallowing them whole!<br /><br />I can't say enough good about this food...

### Love the Brownies! Not so happy with price or delivery.
5 stars for the brownies. These are fantastic brownies...we do add a lot of nuts to ours because that's how we like them. I take them whenever I need a dessert and everyone raves about them! We usually buy these at Cosco for around $9-10/box but since we live far from a Cosco I decided to try ordering them online. 2 stars for price and delivery. In the end it was quite a bit more expensive and they sent the wrong size the 5lb box not the 7.5 lb box which increased the cost per batch even more. I complained to the shipper and they did an adjustment but in the end it was still more expensive and a pain to have to follow up like that. Ordering on line is supposed to be easy right? So I don't know if I will order again... but I will keep buying this product because we love them ;-).

These were wonderful. Because of the reviews I decided to get 3 brands and compare. No connoisseur, however, you still know what is good and what is not. I found these to be tasty, crunchy and fresh with a very nice flavor. I did not find any significant difference between the 3, to tell the truth. They were all organic and raw and to me, they were comparable. None of the 3 stood out as being that much better or worse then the others.  I would buy again, these were shipped fast, as described, great tasting and I just love finding new ways to use them.

### Fibromyalgia
I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

### It triggers my migraines
At first I loved this gum.  I have read a lot about the benefits of xylitol so I was very reluctant to believe anything bad about it.  Then, by process of elimination, I found out that every time I got a migraine, I had been chewing this gum.  I experimented by chewing extra for a few days and then going back to xylitol.  Indeed the xylitol days were marked with severe migraines.  I know I am just one person and a single person's experience is not scientifically rigorous.  That said, if you notice yourself getting headaches, ask yourself if it might not be the xylitol.  Also, please be cautious if you're giving this to children.  They might have a bad reaction to it even if you don't.

### Not as good as DoMatcha
This is an acceptable premium matcha tea.  But if you are looking for the best that Amazon has to offier, this does NOT compare to the DoMatcha 1st harvest organic matcha.  I tried DoMatcha and loved it, and I only strayed based on  the price...this IS a lot less and the reviews seems good enough.  Specifically: It IS about as green as DoMatcha (but  not quite) and decently smooth tasting, just not as "bright" as the DoMatcha 1st harvest.  I do not like the way it is packaged...as once you open it, it is loose in the tin (versus in a foil pouch), so you are going to lose some powder each time you make it just from opening the container. So even though it is cheaper, and you get a small fraction more, you are technically wasting some of the tea.  The tea, also doesn't blend easily with my traditional method of making a paste, then adding milk (I use almond milk) and hot water (not too hot!) and frothing it with the bamboo whisk along the way in stages.  Others have talked about having to sift their matcha, and this particular tea would seem to benefit from sifting, but who has time for that if it isn't necessary?  I have been making a small pitcher of this tea each morning and there is always sediment at the bottom of the pitcher and my cup and I did not experience this with DoMatcha.  So, if you do choose to buy this tea, you will not be unhappy, but you will be happier with DoMatcha 1st harvest organic.  I am going to try the 2nd harvest organic DoMatcha and see if that comes close enough to matching the 1st harvest. If so, that will be an even better buy, dollar for dollar..wait for more reviews.

This was OK.  It tastes more like juice to me.  I didn't get much of the carbonation "bubble" or "fizzies" that you get w/o most carbonated beverages.  Could be because I'm a HUGE Diet C*ke drinker, so I'm used to carbonated beverages. It was a little too sweet for my personal preference and it tasted more like definite cherry than "black cherry."  It also left a bit of an aftertaste in my mouth (took a while for the cherry taste to go away).  I don't think I'd buy it again, and I might recommend it to people who like Cherry flavored beverages, but it's not anything I would say "WOW! You just gotta try this! about.  It was just OK

### So far -- no squirrels !!
A neighbor puts out whole peanuts for what was one squirrel.  Now all the squirrels in town know about it.  They get a bunch of peanuts, all that will fit in their mouth, then come to my flower pots and flower beds to stash them for later.  Not only are my pots & beds sown with peanuts, they dig up everything!!  As soon as I received the product I put out the Havahart Critter Ridder and no trace of squirrels in the pots or flower beds since.  I smoothed the dirt before spreading it and it is still smooth!!  There are no deer around but there are cats...  I don't see signs of cats digging and covering poo out there, but it's harder to detect (until one is digging in the dirt to insert a new plant).  I haven't tried this powder around the edges of the back yard plantings yet to keep my dog from going into the area to 'talk' with the neighbor.  If it DOESN'T keep out the dog, I'll be back to let you know.  So, if you don't hear from me again on this...  it's working for the dog too.  Yeah!!!!  Finally something that truly works (and even after a rain or two on it).  Oh, it was very easy to spread with the built-in shaker.  Since my areas are small I just barely lifted the lid section intended for spreading the product and the right amount came out.  For larger areas one might want to open it further to get a handfull for broadcasting, although I believe it works best as the label describes, to just sprinkle it around areas where you do not want critters to enter.  It's working!!<br /><br />7/9/2012 update:  Saw a squirrel head down the fence top yesterday so it's time to re-apply.  Lasts a good month which is really good for this type of a product.

I immediately felt better and started dropping weight, but quickly got bored with the taste of plain water. A friend suggested adding lemon juice, and the quest for the perfect lemon juice began. After searching high and low, trying brand after brand of lemon juice, I can honestly say that Dream Foods International is the best. It's second only to making the juice yourself from fresh lemons. The flavor is really intense, so you don't need alot, and it doesn't make your water cloudy or discolored like other lemon juices do. And the taste is super refreshing and very lemony. I also love that it comes in a little bottle, so I can throw it in my purse and have it on hand at all times. I will never be without this lemon juice...it's my one true lemony love.<br /><br />P.S. The lime juice is also delicious.

I can't tell the difference between organic and non-organic chocolate just based on the taste of it.  I highly doubt many people could.  But the taste is really great.  Not as bitter as some dark chocolate is, and it melts really well in the mouth - not waxy at all like a cheaper version might be.<br /><br />This is really good chocolate, period.

### It's a mystery (with just a hint of flim-flam)
"... organic dark chocolate chips (organic sugar, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin added as an emulsifier, organic vanilla) ..." - from the ingredients list, BOBO'S OAT BARS, CHOCOLATE<br /><br />Several weeks ago, I reviewed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>, to which I awarded four stars based on its excellent oat flavor and "mouth feel." However, it suffered the loss of a fifth star because "the ostensible banana taste was so subtle as to be virtually non-existent."<br /><br />Because I love chocolate, I decided to give Bobo another shot with the chocolate version of her oat snack.<br /><br />Dark chocolate is on the bar's ingredients list - as chips, no less. Buts it's a complete mystery to me where the essence of chocolate is lurking. Moreover, there isn't a chocolate chip in sight; I pulled the bar apart and examined it carefully. Granted, the bar has a darker shade of color than the other ones of the brand I've tried, so that at least implies chocolate is present. And, there's a faint nuance of some other flavor underlying the taste of oats, but, if anything, it's suggestive of molasses.<br /><br />Mind you, I truly like these bars for the reasons previously stated. And I'll be sure to enjoy the remaining eleven of the dozen "chocolate" ones I purchased. But, as near as I can determine to date with the three types I've eaten, to claim there's any flavor present other than that of oats is a complete fiction and I've had to resist the impulse to award three stars or less for blatantly false advertising.

### Simply the best
These jars of roasted red peppers are absolutely the best brand I've ever tried, and I've had at least 5 different brands over the years.  The peppers are firm, not mushy like so many other brands, the inside of each pepper is amazingly clean and there are very few charred spots on the outside.<br /><br />There is just enough olive oil to make these peppers perfect for salads as well as in cooked dishes and the garlic definitely does not overwhelm the flavor. We use roasted red peppers in place of tomatoes in tuna salad, veggie salads, soups, stews, chili, etc. and these peppers add not only color but extra flavor and texture that are lacking in other brands.......plus being in glass rather than in cans means you do not have to worry about the BPA that is in most can liners.<br /><br />I had a case of these DeLallo peppers with garlic and oil a couple years ago and was delighted to find them on Amazon again.  They cost more than a lot of other brands but are worth every penny.  I can't remember the country of origin of the last case, but these are from Peru and according to the web site whatsonmyfood.org, imported vegetables (and fruit) have MUCH lower pesticide residues on them than the same products from the USA, which is good news if you care about eating healthy food.<br /><br />The packaging was superb, with an extra heavy box stuffed with foam peanuts, and the product arrived in perfect condition.  This is Amazon at its best!

### Strong but bitter
I am a fan of strong coffee and I really enjoyed Emeril's Big Easy k-cups, but this version has a pretty bitter aftertaste.  I'm guessing it's because it's decaf, as I'm having trouble finding a good decaf k-cup.  So I guess for a decaf it's okay if you like strong Starbucks-like coffee, but I'm going to keep trying to find one that's not so bitter before buying this again.

### Tastes GREAT! not filling. And not good for you
This stuff is great. Tastes good, easy to cook, consistent results.<br /><br />But there is not very much in each cup. I could eat 3 and still be hungry.<br /><br />They are sodium BOMBS. 700mg of sodium per cup, 30% of what you should eat in an entire day. You will be very thirsty after eating them because of all that salt. And I heard the more salt in food, the faster you will become hungry after eating it.<br /><br />There are healthier choices out there for a snack. Like White GoGo Rice which only has 10mg of sodium per package.<br /><br />I might buy this again but not for a while.

### Excellent taste. Tangy, Easy to use.
I have personally tried several different mixes for "homemade" Italian dressings in my years of cooking. This one takes the cake.  Most I have tried were too sour, or had too much added sugar.  Several just had a lot of oil flavor and very little seasoning.  Some packaged mixes from the grocery store tasted stale as soon as I mixed them.  Some I tried were very inexpensive, off-the-shelf varieties, others custom ordered from specialty food companies.  This was, by far, the best of them all.<br />The flavor is strong and well-seasoned, like a pub salad with a strong house Italian dressing. Tangy, but not sour. Very dominant flavors, not at all timid like a bottled Italian dressing, and certainly not heavy on the salt, as all bottled varieties seem to be.  The bits of vegetable in the mix were so fresh and pungent that you could taste the celery, red pepper and other flavors in the dressing, even after letting it stand for less than an hour at room temperature.  The directions are easy.  Mix 2 T seasoning with said amount of vinegar. Let stand for 20 minutes and add oil.  If you don't let it stand, the flavor is milder, but still very good.  Everyone in my family who tried it enjoyed the flavor. We tried it on a green salad, first, then made it for a picnic pasta salad which received rave reviews from everyone present.  If you don't like the dressing itself, it works nicely as a salad sprinkle for potato, pasta and vegetable salads with other kinds of dressing.  I also tried using it to add kick to a bottled dressing I was eager to free myself of, and it gave it a much-needed flavor boost.  Overall, I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again in the future.

### Refreshing
I usually only drink sugar-free beverages; however, on a whim I decided to purchase this drink from a local convenience store.  I like the combo of tea and lemonade, but I expected that southern-style tea with pink lemonade would be extraordinarily sweet.  Fortunately, it's not.  It was surprisingly light with just the right amount of sweetness, and I could taste the pink lemonade.  It's really not too different from store bought iced tea with lemon flavor.  I think an ice cold can on a hot summer day would be perfect.<br /><br />Each can is a whopping 23-ounces; they're huge!  Of course, the calorie count is also a whopper - 270 calories with 75 grams of sugar.  I probably won't drink this one again, although if I see the sugar-free variety in my area I'll try it.  However, for fans of full-calorie beverages, I'd definitely recommend Arnold Palmer's Southern Style Sweet Tea with Pink Lemonade for a nice change of pace.  I marked it down a star because of the cost - the price of one can at the store was less than half the per-unit cost for this case.

### LOVE IT!!!  REALLY PERKS UP A SANDWICH!!! GREAT ON FRIES, TOO!!
I had bought the chipotle mayo a while back, and it was good!  I decided to try this garlic and herb and omg, it is the best stuff ever!!  I used to get gourmet sandwiches (back in the days before the economic non-depression, right?) and they put "pesto mayo" on them....well, guess what?  This mayo here is exactly the same as their pesto mayo!  I am thrilled, because I can dress up anything and make it super-special. I hate to admit it, but this is even good to dip french fries in!!

Holy cow this stuff is amazing. How can they even call it tea?  Tea is that boring, flavored water stuff.  This stuff?  Nothing close to boring.  My sister gave me some to try and I can't get over how good it is.  It's like eating some kind of sinfully, delicious dessert, only without all the bad, empty calories.  I add honey to it, but really- you don't even need to add a sweetener.  It can stand alone.  This has the most heavenly aroma too.  But if you're only so-so on cinnamon- BEWARE.  This has intoxicating amounts of cinnamon.  Delicious!  Now, where can I get some more...

### Tasty tea
I'm not a huge tea drinker (coffee every day) but I do enjoy black tea, Earl Grey, Chai tea and this tea is a nice addition. I bought it because I'd heard good things about it including Dr. Oz recommending it. At that point it was a question of which of the many oolongs on AMazon do I buy. I bought three. They are all very similar in flavor, require a touch of sweetener for my tastes but are very good. They are all a bit subdued in flavor with this one being in the middle. I've had no problems with the bags breaking or tea leaves or dust being everywhere.

### A lifesaver for those on gluten-free, yeast-free diet and suffering from many food intolerances.
There aren't many products that are gluten-free and also yeast-free especially in bread.  I have many food intolerances, so most other products add other ingredients which give me a bad reaction.  This isn't the greatest tasting product but when on a limited diet, I am thankful for it.  I always toast mine and add some Smart Balance spread and a slight amount of honey and I look forward to eating it every day.  I buy from six to twelve loaves at a time so I don't run out and place it in the freezor even though the company doesn't recommend it.  I'm happy to see that Amazon is now carrying this bread, so it can just be delivered to my home, and I no longer will have to go to a specialty store which is a distance from my home to buy this product.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFQ1Y4">Ener-G Foods Yeast-Free Brown Rice Loaf, 19-Ounce Units (Pack of 6)</a>

### Made in Michigan since 1866
I like "Vernor's", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is "The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.
