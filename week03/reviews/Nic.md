### Good choice for a daily cup
My first impression was that it was just a decent cup of coffee, but after a week of drinking it, it ended up trumping all other choices, even the espresso pods.  Largely because of cost - the espresso is highly addictive (yes, I think it's that good) and I can't afford to drink three double-shot lattes a day!!!

The description says "no fat" but it is really "no fat added".  It does contain some fat but its less then other granola.<br /><br />I wish i could eat smaller portions, but its so good i keep going back to get more. I guess its still better than eating a box of fat filled sugary cookies.

I drink a fair amount of tea, and black 'breakfast tea' is one of my faves. I prefer to drink it plain/black. I really like this stuff! It can get a bit bitter if left to steep much longer than the recommended 2-3 minutes, so beware of that (I have a tendency to forget about the steeping). But it otherwise has a nice, full flavor and isn't too strong. And I have been able to re-use the teabag for a second cup later in the day with no problems. Note: I make it using the hot water tap from my office coffee maker. Classy! I like tea, but I'm no connoisseur. Just an average tea drinker :)

### They're unsweetened
I initially gave these 2 stars because I found them impossibly sour.  I still wouldn't eat them on their own, but I've since found that they go very well with one of my favorite cereals, Kellogg's Red Berries.  It balances well with the sweetened cereal just like the strawberries that are already in it.  For a snack, I prefer the Crunchies mixed fruit.  It too is unsweetened, but the other fruits in the mixture are sweet enough to carry the strawberries.  It's really very good, especially with the mango bits that give it a unique taste.

### Wonderful Sugar Free Flavoring - Highly Recommended!
The Kahlua Flavor is one of my favorite DaVinci Sugar Free Flavored Syrup types. This was a great find for me since I am a Type 2 diabetic and really have an overpowering sweet tooth.<br /><br />We have tried quite a few of the different brands on the market, but have settled back to DaVinci since the flavors are good and they are sweetened with Splenda. Several of the other brands use Sorbitol (which my wife is slightly allergic to) or Maltitol (which causes me "gastric distress" in large quantities).<br /><br />The real test for anything sugar free is if my kids will use it, and they all like the flavor enough to go out of their way for it. We have used this in coffee and in baking with great results.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

### Outstanding cup of strong black tea
I love a very strong, unsweetened (though I live deep in South Eastern Sweet Tea territory) cup of black tea.<br /><br />I love this tea because you can brew a very strong cup if you like - but without any worries about over-brewing bitterness and such (such as with Typhoo et all) It also doesn't "stack" poorly. I.e. I brew 6-8 bags in my kettle and cut it half to the fridge container (so figure 4 bags per pot) and the extra strength from multiple bags as well as extra time it still comes out very clean strong tea.<br /><br />As in drop the bags into your kettle and in five minutes you're done. Forget and leave them in for 60 minutes? No problem - barely a difference (I'm making iced tea so I don't hover over or immediately pour after normal steep time).<br /><br />All in all - an outstanding cup of black tea. And as strong and you like it. Buy it by the 12 pack as it's somewhat variable in availability.<br /><br />12 pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAZEWA">Lifeboat, Tea, 80-Bag (12 Pack)</a>

They are relatively expensive, but worth it.  This is truly a case of 'you get what you pay for'.<br />Everyone I shared with universally liked these.

### Reviews for the Treat triad, Paw Hide, and Star Spinner
Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.

### Smells Great....
Love, love, love!  The smell of the coffee packs!  When I got this and opened it, honestly, the aroma was just so amazing, it is one of the best smelling coffees I have ever smelled!<br /><br />  If only that taste transferred over....  Unfortunately, when I actually made the coffee, it wasn't extremely flavorful, not was it as dark and rich as I would have hoped.  In fact, it taste a little more like nutty coffee flavored tea, which isn't bad, I love tea!  But if I was coffee, I usually want something that taste strong.  I have had plenty of non-expresso coffees that are rich and almost thick, but this is not one of them.<br /><br />  It is a good light coffee, I suppose if you don't want something too strong, maybe to have with some cookies or muffins at tea time (not a lot of Americans have tea time, but if you do...), it is a nice coffee for that, since it is not too overpowering, it works well in that way.<br /><br />  As long as, when you get this, you know its not a super rich, strong coffee, I think you will enjoy it, its just all about expectations.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

### Delicious and addictive!
These are the best snack food ever! Spicy AND healthy. The 100-calorie packs are a blessing 'cause I could gorge on them. The only drawback is they make your fingers messy, but that's a small price to pay.

### Campbells Hits A Homerun!
So tasty & not overpowering with the spices(re:  doesn't revisit you later).  With lots of large tender chunks of steak it's a hearty meal in a can.  Very disappointed that our Kroger stores no longer handle it but happy and surprised to find it at Amazon & cheaper too!

### Sahale Snacks Valdosta Blend
Quite yummy, not overly sweet, yet satisfies that desire for a sweet treat (thank you, cranberries!). I used this product to help break a longtime candy/sugar habit. Pecans. Dried cranberries. Black pepper. Mmmm.

### My cats like it.
Good food = healthy cats and less vet bills.<br /><br />High ratings from review sites lead me to try this when I adopted 2 cats recently. From the first day they took to it without a problem. No mixing with their old cat food was needed. They were both a little underweight at first but in a months time I have noticed a huge difference. Their fur is sooo much softer now and they are at the perfect size. They have been using the litter box regularly and in a months time neither of them have had an upset stomach.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great reviews from people who know about cat diets. My cats like it. Soft coats.<br /><br />Cons:<br />High price.

### Best savings I could find
When we finally settled on Enfamil's Gentlease for our baby, I tried to find the best price on it I could. This six case carton was hands-down the most savings. And even better, with my Prime membership, I get it in just over a day from the time I order it.

### disappointed
I am very disappointed with this gum. I used in for a long time and noticed that the formula had changed a few months ago. I called the company and was told that the gum base was changed. That was a big mistake to me because it doesn't last very long and within about 10 min. or less it becomes very rubbery. I am now trying a different Zylitol gum hoping for better alternative.

### Very good
This tea has a light, fruity taste (the strawberry in particular is very distinct), with a bit of natural sweetness to it.  It's very good either hot or iced.<br /><br />I went through my first box of this in under a week.  Looks like I've found a new favorite.  Everyone I've served it to so far has loved it, too.

### tasty lettuce
My husband loves having salad greens so I thought he would be pleased when I bought this. However, at first glance he thought it wasn't going to produce enough lettuce for the huge salads he likes to eat and he said he wished I had bought herbs instead like we did last time. So far we've harvested twice and the taste of the lettuce has been lovely. The first harvest was small, enough to decorate the side of two plates. The second salad was much larger, enough for two American style side salad plates. The chef pack comes with enough pods to grow an Aerogarden full of lettuce twice. I pulled off some lettuce for a sandwich once, and that seems like a good use of this thing (concerning the volume issue).

### Too dry and sharp
I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.

### Love the large size
My dad has become addicted to flavored coffees since someone sent him some as a gift. The problem is that he drinks at least 6 cups per day.  I've purchased many flavors to determine what he likes best.  This is one of his favorites.  It isn't one that I particularly care for but I do love that it comes in a larger size than I can get from the manufacturer of my coffee machine.

### Different effects for everyone!!
Please be aware that this product, like any other supplement or energy drink you can try, will have different effects for each user. To think that it would react the same for everybody would be saying that everybody has the same exact body shape and health, metabolism, etc. Personally, it works wonders for me. I am 20 and in fit shape, and it does a perfect job of keeping me awake and focused at work. I drink one on days when I didn't get enough sleep the night before, and within 5 minutes I can go from stumbling around with heavy eyes to being alert and productive. For me personally, there is no crash afterward, I simply return to however I was before I took the drink. My only concern is the possible long-term effects, but since I do not use it on habit, just on those days when I really need it, I am not really worried about it. Highly recommended, but do not feel scammed if it doesn't work for you. It simply might not be as effective on your body.

### Delicious and Very easy to make!
I received the product this week and the first thing I like to notice when I buy grocery and edible items are the experimentation date (mines says July 2012). This is almost a year, so if you are like me and only drink lattes here and there, you have over half a year to sample and taste this product :)<br /><br />I did not try this product with water, I tried it with milk and it does taste like pumpkin spice. For those of us who have tried the Starbucks version of pumpkin spice, it is not as sweet and a bit more pumkiny and less cinnamony (but you can alter the taste if you would like by adding more or less product or even sugar/splenda to the taste though I would not recommend it). I find the taste to be more 'grown-up' than the Starbucks version since the pumpkin spices I have had from Starbucks the baristas always make them very sugary.<br /><br />There is some foam that is created on the top, mines was a very thin layer of foam, but you get more foam if you put in more product.<br /><br />Product says "dishwasher safe" but not microwavable safe so I guess you can wash the tin and reuse it for other items such as sugar or even to put small cookies in.<br /><br />TASTE: A<br />PRICE: Box says 17 servings (price at time of review = 34.22 for 4, so thats $8.55 per box and $.50 per serving)<br />If I want the latte to be very tasty, I double the serving, so depending on taste, each latte you make will cost about $.50 to 1 dollar per latte [excluding cost of milk]<br />VERY CHEAP compare to starbucks!<br /><br />OVERALL: A-

### Familiar taste, new packaging, worth the price?
These crackers are exactly what you expect from Honey Maid - familiar graham taste, serrated lines for breaking the crackers, etc.  The big development (if you will) here, are the "fresh stacks" - that is, slightly different packaging from the originals. Instead of four-panel crackers sealed in two packets within the box, you get six stacks of eight, two-panel (half of the original) crackers.<br /><br />The packets are not reseal-able and each contains what the nutrition facts consider to be two servings (one serving is four squares and each packet contains 8 squares).<br /><br />As with many grocery items that are packaged for convenience (baby carrots, pre-sliced apples, etc.) you pay more.  If you're looking for an easy, pre-packed snack for an outing...I suppose this helps but it is up to you to decide whether your time is worth the extra cost here.

### Tasty
I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying.

### Kids love'em, All be it a little messy.
Jammy Sammys are like minature ceral bars for small hands.  They can crumble and fall apart, so not a good car travel snack.  Kids love these things though.  So if you are looking for an organic option, that is small hand friendly, portable and fun - these fit the bill.

### Great stuff!
If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best.  It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol.  But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects.  If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar.  If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste.  Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste.  If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste.  This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar.  You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia.  It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter.  You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it, in spite of their "100% satisfaction guarantee". I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.<br /><br />Also:  It is a bit misleading that they call this particular item "powdered".  Regular powdered sugar is pulverized and has cornstarch added to give it that silky feel, as well as calcium phosphate to improve its flowing ability.  What they mean here, though, is that it is a much finer grain than their regular erythritol.  It is still a grain, however.  I buy it because it dissolves faster than the larger crystals, but both are good products.

### Good treats!
Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training. I will always keep these in stock for him!

### ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!
I couldn't disagree more with the previous review. No, they're not chocolate, they're soy. But they are delicious!! I find myself eating handfuls right out of the bag, but they are also great in cookies. They have a buttery, highly vanilla flavor, and a handful of them makes me think instantly of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone. If you love vanilla you should love these just as candy.

### Dinner Club is GREAT
I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on "pasta night" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.<br />It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always brag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle- dinner of the month club.<br />I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones.
