### Only food my cats can agree on
This is the only flavor of Science Diet (or any other brand) they will all eat without complaint. I don't know what I'll do if they stop making it. I have 3 cats, two Maine Coons who get hairballs, and this stuff really works to prevent that. As long as they eat some of it daily no more hairballs on the floor. It's a great product. I hope they never try to "improve" the recipe or change it in any way, or my cats will probably reject it as they have so many others! If it ain't broke please don't fix it, Science Diet! It's a winner as is.

### Good for Feline UTI
I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me.

### You can really taste that sucralose
To be fair, I think I'd give any of these miniature packets of "healthy" "water boosters" a two-star review. They're just not all that tasty, and all have a nasty aftertaste from the artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This product almost earned itself a one-star review because in addition to the aftertaste, there are little crumbly bits in it that just aren't a pleasant thing to encounter in a beverage. It was a rather nasty experience overall, really, but it saved itself from one star because the actual fruit and green tea flavours were really quite nice.

I have been a long time user of Cutter's Backyard Bug Control but problems with the sprayer began a couple of years ago for me. The chemicals work fine and does last awhile but maybe not as long as claimed. The sprayer of a few years ago meant it was difficult to get the product out. I switched to another vendor and tried Cutter's again this year. Well, it got worse because a plastic piece of the head broke off immediately after I attached the hose and turned it on. I will not be getting this product again. Their quality control for dispensing the product is the worse I have seen for a major name brand.

### Great grapefruit taste that is not too sweet.
I really enjoyed the grapefruit flavored IZZE.  At first it was a little strong, but the flavor efinitely grew on me.  I am not one who likes grapefruit, but I normally enjoy grapefruit flavored sodas like Squirt.  Unlike Squirt, IZZE tastes like real grapefruit juice, just carbonated.  It is not overly sweet and is quite refreshing.  It reminds me of the sports drink "Super Socco" from the mid-80's.<br /><br />I would definitely endorse this flavor for anyone who enjoys a tart drink.

### Better than Chocolate!
This product is amazing. The smell as soon as the bag is open is heavenly - such a 'real' chocolate aroma. And the taste is so much better!<br />It is promoted as being able to brew just like coffee - that is you can use it in a drip machine or french press. But it doesn't 'taste' like coffee - this is full on chocolate tasting!!  Personally I dont like it made with water, I prefer the creaminess of a hot chocolate made with milk.  But i do make the concentrate as per instructions on their website - mix some Crio Bru (quite a bit!) with sugar and water - boil and simmer to make a cacao concentrate that can be added to anything for a chocolate fix.  Even poured over ice cream!  And that it has no sugar or fat (marginal) of its own - it is guilt free, which you just cant believe as you take a sip - the flavour is so much fuller, stronger, smoother than any hot chocolate or even candy bar I've had. And I'll happily give them up and live on Crio Bru!  The only down side is that being ground cacao beans, you do need to strain any liquid drinks or syrups you make - although they grind is quite edible on its own if you dont mind a bit of 'roughage'. It is great added into granola or the like 'raw' straight from the pouch.

### Things you need to know
Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

### Alessi will MAKE your dressing!
I'm new Balsamic vinegar. A friend gave me a bottle of Alessi, and I've made a note of its name. I couldn't find it in my local store. I've bought another brand, but the new brand says nothing about how long it has been aged, for example, in wood, and I suspect that I have been spoiled for lesser quality.<br /><br />I didn't like vinaigrette before, even with the highest quality olive oil. Now that I've made it with a good Balsamic vinegar I understand why. Well made and properly aged Balsamic vinegar is nothing like even the highest quality red wine vinegar. It has a nice sharp tangy taste, but it is, in and of itself, a dressing for salad. That is why it can be used alone or with oil to dress salads.<br /><br />Alessi has a sweetness to it that suddenly makes sense of the notion that nuts and fruits can be included with miscellaneous salad greens to take a salad in a different direction. This product opened up new vistas of salad making to me, and I give it a full five stars and encourage anyone who likes to play with food to try it.

Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />"cocoa."  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~

### Great Cuppa...except
Ok, now on our third box of Breakfast in Bed. We had become fans of Donut House and Coffee Shop, looking for that balanced smooth "Dunkinesque" brew. We found ourselves coming up just a bit short in the strength/flavor area. Corrections were made in brew size and eventually adding in a bit of Emeril's Bold or various dark roasts. Well problem solved with the B in B. Smooth and flavorful and a good eye-opener. (Was worried the name somehow implied less caffeine)Based on our experience in these areas, 5 stars. The "except"? On three seperate occasions out of two boxes purchased seperately, we had "exploding" K-cups! A small pop during brewing that sent coffee grounds spewing over and in the Keurig, counter top, and coffee cup. This at our home brewer AND our vacation house. Messy. Very messy, requiring unplugging and careful cleaning inside cup holder and area. Minus 1 star. Umm, exactly who makes these things and where...hopefully a road bump on the way to sucess. Peace.

### Awesome sugar free soda!
I have never really been a soda fan ever. Growing up as a kid the only soda I thought tasted good was root beer. As an adult and a vegan I know very well that regular sodas are just empty calories and a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup so I have stayed far far away from them.<br /> I use stevia for my coffee in the morning and I love it. I have done the research on all artificial sweeteners and I wont go near those chemicals. Amazon had recommended this to me by other things i have purchased. I was too nervous to buy 24 of them since i don't like soda and it could have tasted terrible. So my solution was to get a 6 pack at my local store.<br /><br />All i have to say is WOW! It has a great root beer taste. I am so pleased with this product I plan on keeping this an auto-ship. I recommend this to people who want yummy soda without the soda and future cancer.

### Not that great
I expected these burgers to be better from the reviews. In the package they look great - fresh frozen with great deep red color. One good thing is that the do retain their size/shape after cooking. But the reason is because they are very lean so the fat doesn't cook out. The huge downside to that is fat = flavor. These were very dry because of the lack of fat to keep them moist and juicy. Unforunately I bought 20 burgers so I have a lot to eat. I will not buy them again.

I am not sure why you would criticize them for being sweet, i mean the title is Cinnamon Danish after all? Of course its sweet, I think that is the point. If you just want a cereal bar Healthy valley has plain old fruit filled cereal bars too, I think of this as a healthy alternative to candy bars or reaching for cookies during my day. Highly recommend them for those trying to live a healthy life, but just need some sweets too!

A couple of weeks after we transitioned my dog to this food, she became ill.  Very bad diarhea that just got worse and worse until she we getting up in the night and had blood in her feces.  Since this has happened, I have heard about this happening to other dogs.  Too big a risk, the ingredients are right, but the result is extremely bad.

### Not what I expected
The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!

### Great Product!
I am a huge candy fanatic and Haribo is my personal favorite gummi maker. Again they did not disappoint! these candies are the perfect texture (not too soft) and each flavor is distinctive. These along with Rowntree Fruit gums are my favorites! Highly recommended!

### the best coffee
it's the best if you like dark and bold. my wife thinks it smells foul but i like dark coffee, chocolate, and beer. this is a rich coffee experience.<br />the only caveat is all K cups are, in my estimation, overpriced. AND they are not recyclable.

### okay product, not good packaging all dented
I bought this to make vietnamese coffee. It taste okay, I love that it's organic, but thats as far as it goes. Frankly, the only reason this item deserves 3 stars is because it's certified organic and taste like it should. The packaging is plain horrible.<br /><br />I bought a $10 can opener JUST for this item. The can opener is great, one of those swing-away or something openers that old-school people from the war eras swear by. My mom had a can opener 15 years ago and I vaguely recall using it in highschool when I still lived at home. I've managed to live for the past 10 years without one and I eat my fair share of canned goods. Even my cat's food doesn't need an opener and he gets 2 cans a day.<br /><br />Anyhow, 5 of these 6 cans were dented, but I checked and it seems edible/safe from botulism. None of the dents look like it was actually punctured. Still, the dents near the top made it impossible to open the can. So messy and sticky. Storing this thing is also a pain in the arse. Unless you plan to bake 5 pies and use the whole thing, the packaging is just plain horrible. It looks like it belongs in the 50s and is so outdated. It's not like it's a quarter or something extremely cheap, I don't understand why they can't update the packaging to make it more user friendly. Will buy a squeeze bottle next time. Actually I wanted to buy the squeeze bottle in the first place but the organicness made me think it was worth an entire extra $10 can opener purchase.<br /><br />If you want to use this for just coffee like me, stay away and get the squeeze bottle. If you are planning to bake 5 pies in one day, then awesome product for you (but they should then advertise it for only that use and I would have never made this purchase).

### We love it!
These have more substantial "Bite" than the shells or elbows which we like.  The sauce is good, I recommend using very little milk to start, and whisk in the cheese powder. Add only a tad more milk if you need to.  Drain the pasta really well.  I like to add a pat of butter for richness.  Otherwise, you may wind up with watery or lumpy sauce, which isn't necessary and can be avoided.

### For the big dogs only
This is packaged in a resealable, air tight pouch which is easy to open.  The treats are thick and quite hard.  They are scored so they can be snapped in two, with a bit of effort.<br /><br />I called my canine food testing panel, Hunter - a four year old, 65 lb Golden Retriever, and Boston - a three year old 35 lb mixed breed.  Both members of the panel were called and appeared quite interested when the treat package was opened, although it must be noted that this is their usual response to any promise of food.  Each caught the treat when it was tossed and quickly gobbled it down, then stared at the bag waiting for a second sample.  After receiving treats for two days both panel members would return from the yard immediately when the bag was shaken and they were called - high praise indeed from this pair.<br /><br /> These treats are quite hard and did require that some chewing  occur rather than their usual practice of swallowing things whole which I considered a plus as it would help clean their teeth to some extent.  I do though question as to whether a small dog or one with diseased (or missing) teeth would be able to chew these treats.  To test this I offered these treats to my cats, and although both expressed interest in them neither were able to bite into the treats.<br /><br />I liked this product, both my dogs were happy with the treats (although to be fair neither one has ever been picky).  I was impressed that the ingredients were all natural and found the packaging quite convenient to use.  For my two dogs the hardness was a plus as it did make them chew even a bit rather than gulping whole.  I do not though think that this would be a good product to give a very young puppy, a small dog or one who had any dental problems as I do not think these animals would be able to safely break up the treats.

Great taste. It reminds me of Juicy Fruit gum. My wife loves it and so do I. But like the spearmint flavor, it doesn't last very long; it's not terribly short either.<br />Try it, you'll like it. Subttle taste, smooth, it doesn't feel like a sugar rush in your mouth. Excellent product.

### Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

### Senseo Sumatra Pods are Great!
I have used a Senseo maker for about three years, making 3 to 10 cups a day. (I'm on my third machine.) Mostly I have used other brand pods for the bolder flavor, but these Sumatra pods are about as good as any I have tried.<br /><br />Some other brand coffees I like are from Wolfgang Puck and Reunion Island; however, these other brands wreck the mechanism of the Senseo due to the thicker pod. These Senseo pods work better and taste just as good.<br /><br />I lived in Germany for three years and really learned to like European style coffees. Nothing makes crema like a Senseo!

### Pit Bull LOVES it!
My Pit Bull loves this toy.  At first he wouldn't touch it, but I put just a touch of Kong peanut butter on the ball and put it in his crate.  He spent the next two hours devouring the "everlasting" treat.  So the treat ISN'T everlasting, but the fun is!  I put all sorts of things in the ball.  I've put dry cat food, about half of his dinner (dry dog food), treats, you name it.  He even carries the thing around when it's empty.  Great toy for entertaining destructive pups!

### Surprising
I am not fan of oatmeal. I don't care how healthy it is, just didn't like it. However I needed to add more fiber to my diet so I began trying different brands and flavors. My experience has been that the ones with "healthy" on the label, taste far worse that those that omitted that word. I must say that when I first tried this oatmeal I was prepared to dislike it before taking the first bite. I was surprised, the flavor is incredible. There are even chunks of apple in it. Now, not only am I eating a lot more oatmeal, but I'm enjoying it. Thanks Kashi!

### excellent tea, recommended to take a fenugreek supplement as well
This tea is really really good!  It's worth drinking for the taste alone!  I started drinking this tea when my baby was only eight weeks old and my milk supply already started to dry up.  I also recommend taking fenugreek and milk thistle with this product (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008RH67GE">Fenugreek (610mg) 100 Capsules + FREE Milk Thistle Powder 25 Grams</a>).  I drank the tea by itself for the first week but then panicked when my milk supply only slightly increased.  I don't think there is quite enough fenugreek in this tea because I added the fenugreek and milk thistle after it being recommended to me and literally the next day my milk supply was back in full force.  Did I say the tea tastes great, always a plus!

### The flavours are not lies!
These beans are a wonderful thing. The good flavors, you can eat, and they are totally fantastic. The terrible flavors, you can belittle the manhood of your friends with. The in-between flavors? Like grass? They're largely there to confuse you, and do so wonderfully.<br /><br />To sum up my experience with them, an anecdote:<br /><br />Driving along one summer, eating said beans, my two friends convince me to eat the Booger flavoured one. "Okay," I begin "but only if you get a good flavored one ready to get the taste out of my mouth."<br /><br />My first friend passes me the booger-bean, and gets a grape-bean ready on deck. The booger bean was mostly flavourless... until the saliva hit my tongue! Retching, I spat out the window, and demanded the grape bean. Blargh! The dark colour tricked them! It was dirt! Spitting again, I demanded another bean. They produced another dark coloured one, this one seeming noticeably more purple in the light. Noooo! It was more dirt!<br /><br />Pulling over, and spitting out the bean, they presented me with a white one. "Alright," they said "This can only be popcorn, or marshmallow."<br /><br />Seeing no bad option, I took the bean and chewed it gratefully. Then I vomited in my mouth.<br /><br />It was neither popcorn, nor marshmallow. It was rotten egg!<br /><br />Suffice to say, that these are not the kind of jelly bean you buy, thinking that every one of them will be wonderful. The rotten egg, dirt, soap, and vomit beans all taste exactly what they are supposed to. And that is what makes them a fantastic product.

This is a beautiful plant!  It arrived in excellent condition, healthy.  I only had a 7" hanging planter and was hesitant about repotting this plant into a pot that large (it arrived growing in a 4" pot) thinking it might be too much of a skip in size.  However, when I saw the roots and tubers, I knew this pot was the right choice.  This plant is ready to take off and grow.  I'm going to hang it in by my kitchen window where it will get filtered sunlight.  So excited to see it grow.  Highly recommend this plant.
