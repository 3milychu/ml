### Think of having a peppermint starlight mint that prevents tooth decay!
That's really what this product is, a healthy version of a starlight mint.  It tastes like a candy cane, but you can eat it just before you go to bed or any time of the day.  Individually wrapped, these are great breath mints for people on the go.  My kids like to grab one on their way to school.  I wish they made a chocolate mint version.

### Good product - but not JUST pears.
I am a big fan of Happy Baby products but was really disappointed to see that this one (and perhaps others as well) had lemon juice among the ingredients. I don't understand why that is even necessary. Our son has very sensitive skin and breaks out around his mouth and chest whenever certain foods come in contact with his skin - and I bet that the lemon juice could be the culprit here.<br /><br />I just wish it wasn't so hard to find a product that had only what it says it has on the front packaging. The Amazon description didn't even say it.<br /><br />Word of warning for parents of kids with citrus allergies/sensitivities.

### Ahmad Loose Imperial Blend Tea is great for the price
A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it.

### Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

### Not for Cats
I have 3 cats with 3 different personalities. None of them were impressed with these treats at all. I gave each one of them a fourth of a treat as I have small cats and the treats are rather large. All three were interested as I was getting the packaging open. Two of the cats tried to eat the treat, but they were not able to chew it. One gave up after just a little bit and the other gave it a pretty good effort and even came back to try again a minute later. Then I decided to take another treat and crumble it up really good. I laid it out for them. One cat actually ate a few pieces, but that was it. The second cat didn't even come over to try and the third actually tried to bury it.

### easiest way to make great coffee from a pod
I have been using Lavazza for the past 20 years since discovering it in Italy. I am glad to see it become more available in the past few years. For the true barista go for the ground lavazza bar but for the easy no fuss no mess espresso or capuccino/latte the Lavazza pod is consitently the best that I have tried. I use both products and have been very satisfied. Works great in my krups with the pod filter basket. I highly reccommend it.

### Decent coffee
As the description says: this is for single-serve "pod" type brewers, and it will be quite the pain to use if you're using a Keurig or a Mr. Coffee. Keep that in mind...<br /><br />Now, to the coffee: it was good in a 6-8oz brew, with the flavors being pretty much as described. However, at 15 pods to a pack, this a week's worth of coffee if you drink a 15 oz mug every morning, as I do. So, while it is a good coffee when made properly, the value just is not there for me with this product.<br /><br />If you're okay with that, because you see value added by the social marketing related to this product, then go for it.<br /><br />If you're just after good coffee, you can probably get just as good a cup with a different brand for a little less.

### Calories are the divine punishment for tastiness!
And Heaven knows that Caramello bars are absolutely divine!<br /><br />When you open a Caramello bar for the first time, you might think, "what's the big deal?"  It smells and looks like a normal-ish Hershey bar, which is as good as all Hershey bars, but why are these people so obsessed?  If it's a warm day, the bar will have cracked open, and you will already know -  but for the sake of this review, it's a normal day, the bar is in one piece, and you haven't discovered the incredible surprise that makes a Caramello the sinful and delicious treat that it is.<br /><br />Break the bar open and pull the two pieces apart.  There it is -- a ribbon of soft, delicious, tasty caramel, just waiting for you to pounce.  And you had better pounce quickly, because this stuff recognizes new/expensive/dry clean only clothing and  will pounce on you if it has to wait.  But the pounce and slurp are so worth it -- completely delicious, and when you take a bite of that chocolate shell, you know what's for lunch in Heaven.<br /><br />But there has always been a snake in the Garden of Eden, and the name of this snake is Calories.  Specifically, 540 calories for the 4 oz bar I'm reviewing.  200 of those calories are fat, which makes this food a true splurge.  You can't even fake that it's providing superior nutrition for all those calories, because the only good stuff in appreciable quantities is the 8% calcium the bar provides.  A single Viactiv chew Viactiv Soft Calcium Chews, 500+D+K, Milk Chocolate, 90-Count Boxes (Pack of 2) provides 500 mg of calcium, half of your daily requirement, at a measly 20 calories.<br /><br />On those days when you can afford a treat, or those other days when you must have a treat and the heck with the diet - this is one heck of a splurge.  It's incredibly delicious, chewy, slurpy and crunchy all in one treat, and you can lick your fingers afterward.  If you do it right, it's more than a snack, a Caramello bar is an experience.

The process is noisy due to the foil of the bubble pack.<br /><br />The gum chews nicely - a crunchy shell that quickly blends into a nice texture. There's a little gel bit in the middle. Meh.<br /><br />There's a bit of ginseng in the gum, but...well...I'd never have known this except that it's on the package.<br /><br />I've found the flavor to be good and long-lasting.<br /><br />So...good stuff that's a bit expensive.

These are by far the best rice cakes I have tried. They are really crunchy and don't have that styrofoamy quality that most cheap rice cakes have. They also taste great. Not too salty or too sweet - you can actually taste the rice. Only complaint is that they crumble a lot and have to be careful not to drop all that goodness on the floor. That means I have to use a plate or eat them over the sink. In any case, they taste so good that this minor problem will not prevent me from buying them again.

### I can enjoy soda again this summer! This really is a nice grape flavor soda pop, even for stevia haters (like me)!
I want to say up front that I hate the taste of stevia. I tried it years ago when it first became the natural sweetener to try. I gagged. I tried it again in its updated "better" offerings. Still don't like it. Not even the popular Truvia could win me over.<br /><br />But it's getting to be summer, and though I mostly drink water/coffee/tea/coconut milk, I wanted a nice summery change of taste without calories or sugar or aspartame. So, yeah, I tried this.<br /><br />I decided to check out the grape first, as that one got consistently good reviews in the websites/blogs I visited to see what folks are saying. I got it today.<br /><br />I'm drinking it now WARM (arrived at my Miami doorstep 15 mins ago, so imagine it's not anywhere near cool here). I figured I'd taste it and, if I didn't like it, not bother to have it take up precious space in my crowded-with-produce fridge. I had a worry that my stevia-repulsed tastebuds would yell, yet again.<br /><br />Well, blow me down with a carbonated breath! This is GOOD! So good, I decided to come on and review it positively.<br /><br />I'm guessing the major lifting work of sweetening is being done by the erythritol (which I've had in stuff before and never bothered me, though I did sense the cooling effect). That's fine by me. I don't get weird rumbly tums from erythritol, and it's never had any funky effect on me like some report with aspartame.<br /><br />So, hey, I have a summer soda pop! I'm gonna order a six-pack of various other flavors to see if they measure up. The grape definitely measures up. And I'm even enjoying it WARM. :) I can't wait to see how it is fully chilled.<br /><br />And I appreciate that it doesn't have weird purple coloring. It's a clear fizzy liquid in my cup. I hate weird colored sodas.<br /><br />Thanks, Zevia. Nice grapey treat.

General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian.

### Gourmet Salt
Fleur de Sel gives more intensity to salad dressings and is the moist, caviar of salt that is hand raked from the surface of salt ponds on the coast of France during July and August. You will need a mortar and pestle to grind the salt if you use it in recipes, but it is so worth your time.<br /><br />This salt has a distinct salty-from-the-sea flavor that is unique to these salts. The flavor just fills your entire mouth. Normal table salt will pale in comparison and almost has a chemical aftertaste in comparison to this highly prized salt.<br /><br />French chefs have known this secret forever and when I found this salt, I told everyone I knew about the flavor. Sprinkle this salt onto anything you want just before serving, especially good on steaks or freshly cooked vegetables. Also delicious with butter and rosemary on freshly baked bread.<br /><br />Want to taste the best caramels ever? Look for Fleur de Sel Caramels. They will not last long.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

### A fan
Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.<br />I drank this in the evenings and it is like it melted everything away including the anxiety of staying with my mother and dealing with her obsession of cleaning with her new mini sweeper, going here and there to see this and that person, having to of course spend extra money that I normally don't, AND having my Weimaraner at my moms hearing her gripe about what his claws will do to her wood floor. I know, too much information but seriously....I generally crack and I held it together this time. I give some of the credit to this stuff. Its taste is pleasant and it is easy for an on the go status like what I was.<br />I recommend this to anyone who has a lot on their plate, especially if it is temporary and you aren't used to dealing with it all on a regular basis. That kind of stress can lead to a meltdown! I usually get sick with a really bad cold or such within a week of being back in my own environment but this time I did not. I wonder....well, I didn't have as much stress knocking my immune system down to germ take over levels maybe. Either way, I like it and I am a gonna keep it! In fact, I am going home again in 3 days....Calm, don't fail me now! :D

### DisposaKups
When I used the k-cup filter that came w/keurig, I didn't like the taste of any coffee I used so I stopped using it altogether.  However, when I saw DisposaKups on Amazon, I had my doubts but took a chance...They worked great.  Plan to keep them in stock.

### Jalapeno Potato Popchips, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)
I love these things.  Makes me feel better not eating preservatives.  I also like the "kick" from the jalapeno.  This is my "cheat" snack and not bad for 21 chips at 120 calories.  I've gotten other people hooked on these too.  Love 'em

### Product is great! But don't pay this price!
This product is great, it tastes good and removes harmful sugar and artificial sweeteners from something that we all love to enjoy.  But do not buy it here, unless you just love to throw you money out the window. Head over to Josephslitecookies.com and find it there for only 2.99 a bottle! I don't know how these people are getting away with charging this much. Perhaps if you live over seas and Josephs wont ship to you then you would pay extra but otherwise there's no need! As far as causing gas problems, well that depends on each individual. Some may have no discomfort what so ever, while others may need to avoid all sugar alcohols(because they all CAN cause gastrointestinal problems)

### Excellent tea, our all-time favorite
The flavor is poetry. There are very few Darjeeling teas that come close to Ahmad Tea London's Darjeeling.<br /><br />We have tried many, including teas from coffee & tea boutiques like Peets and none of them quite compare.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but also highly 'addictive'.

### Easy way to make popcorn
About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store.  I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them.  I do not have to worry about portions or measuring.  Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture.  Super easy! No mess either.  I love it!  The popcorn is delicious and I have to sometimes keep myself from eating it all.

### Too strong IMO
I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here.

### Not for me
I saw the word "pomegranate" and jumped into action, bought this at Sam's Club.  Tasting these reminded me of the old TV commercial: "where's the beef?".  To me it was just big pieces of chocolate and nothing more.  I expected it to be like raisinettes or something, it wasn't. It was the chocolate without the inner 'raisin.' The last portion in the bag has been sitting idly on my counter for too long.  If they were any good, they'd be long gone by now.

### wish I'd started using it 5 years ago
I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.  The other always vomits ten minutes after eating, no matter what she eats: canned or dried makes no difference and I've tried every store brand there is.  Hairball treatments had no effect.  I figured "cats throw up" and didn't worry about it.  When I moved and switched vets the new vet asked if the cats ever threw up.  When she heard about the one cat she said cats do NOT just throw up and told me to get the Science Diet sensitive stomach food.  Yes, it's 4x the price of what I'd been buying, but I noticed a difference with the first bowl.  Instead of throwing up ten minutes after literally every meal, now she throws up maybe once a month.  If only I'd switched to this brand years ago we both would have been saved a lot of misery.  Even tho it costs more I've noticed that the bag seems to last longer than the same amount of cat chow did.

### Chopped nuts
The description of the item is "small pieces, diced."  I would call them chopped. They're basically what you'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box.

### I love Fog Chaser
Fog Chaser is my favorite coffee and I buy it in whole beans for when I brew a full pot.  I have used it for years and would not think of changing.  When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.

### Crunchy with a bit too much cinnamon
Very similar to the Oatmeal Square cereal in the blue box that are just lightly sweetened.  This cereal adds a taste of cinnamon to the mix.  Like its counterpart, it holds up nicely to milk and stays crunchy throughout.  The cinnamon flavor is actually a bit overwhelming, however.  Still, a nicely textured cereal and a good alternative to the typical flaked cereal.

### Serenditpity 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate Mix Canister
This product was advertised on Oprah as being something to try before you die, which is why I tried it. I was expecting it to be really good, and I was disappointed in it.  Maybe it would be better at the location in New York.  It is very rich and it is good, I just wouldn't describe it as something to try before you die.

### Defective Bags
I always purchase bags on board to pick up my puggles poop. I normally buy the blue bags but decided to purchase the colorful ones because they were a couple dollars cheaper at the time. I guess these bags are defective because I have had a few of the bags open on the wrong end and my hand went all the way through. This is not good when you are about to pick up poo. So I don't know if it was just a bad batch or what but I will definitely go back to buying the blue bags as I have never had a problem with those ones.

I have been waiting for a drink that tasted good AND had the kick in it to keep me awake.  This is it.

### My puppy goes crazy!!!
I saw these treats online and was going to order them but I went to my local grocery store and they had them there for a 1.00 cheaper. I brought these home and my cocker spaniel puppy has been going crazy for them ever since. He gobbles them up. He even starts to cry and whine when I open the bag because he wants it so bad. I'm glad its a healthy option for him. He loves the pumpkin/banana ones better then the pumpkin/apple. I haven't tried the others because I know that cockers can be sensitive to allergys. I also saw the chewy ones at the store as well so I will try those and update my review.
