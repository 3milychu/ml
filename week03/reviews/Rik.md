### I could taste the lime and mint flavoring, and it's not ultra sweet
Crystal Light Mojito Mocktail<br /><br />Although I have never tried any alcoholic Mojito drinks, the Crystal Light Mojito mocktail mix was very good. The overall taste is not overly sweet, and I can definitely taste the lime and mint flavoring. It is not an overpowering sensation, although it isn't as sweet of a drink as the Crystal Light margarita mocktail mix or some of Crystal Light's other flavored teas and drinks.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, not overly sweet, and I could definitely taste the lime and mint. I drank an entire quart in one meal and thought it was fairly good although not something a child may enjoy since it isn't as sweet as the other Crystal Light flavored teas and juices.

I really liked this dinner because I love broccoli and cheese but the chicken made it really good.  My husband liked it too, and he usually hates broccoli.  Its easy too, which I love and velveeta tastes great with the chicken.  I only wish the pasta noodles were a bit bigger, but they were still great tasting.  I will buy this again.

### Fantastic!
Our family is crazy about this stuff.  It's fantastic right out of the can, but it's also perfect for any recipe that calls for ground beef.  I use this for chili, tacos, sloppy joes, lasagna, and if you add some greek seasoning, it's a perfect for gyros!  This is also great for non-vegetarians looking for healthy and low fat alternatives to ground meat.

Wow!!!  This cat food must have something like catnip in it.  After the first smell and taste, the cats have come at the first sound of opening another can.  My cats seem to really appreciate the taste.  It smells fine to me.  Cat food is cat food, to me, but, to my closest friends, at least my cats, they love this product.  It's a little more expensive than the cat food that I could purchase in a discount store, but, here again, I think that my cats seem to enjoy this a bit more.

### multigrain taste and not too salty; too bad they are fried and not baked
While I enjoyed eating these chips, I doubt I would order them again.  The positives are that they are not too salty and they have a good, multigrain taste.  (I suppose this latter quality might be a minus for some who don't like the taste of whole grains.)  The negatives are that a fairly small serving size (one ounce) has 7 grams of fat because these chips are fried, not baked.  So while these are made using whole grains that aren't genetically modified, I'd hesitate to call them a healthful snack because of the high fat content.

### Excellent Gluten Free Cereal
Started eating this cereal about 6 months ago, buying it in the Organic section of the local grocery.  However, being a popular cereal, it was out on occasion, so I started having a monthly delivery from Amazon, which is working excellently.  The cereal has a texture and taste that puts the National brands to shame.  If you need a gluten free cereal or just want one that has a natural, good taste, try this Nature's Path cereal.

### Milder than most of the bold flavors with a slight  zing of lime citrus flavor!
These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!

### Chemical supplements should be taken based on the advice of a qualified health care provider
As I have problems with sleep at night and tried all sorts of things which are most commonly recommended to improve it, I tought I try this well rated product. I tried it in all the various recommended dosages. But it didn't make the slightest difference for me. Thus I guess that it probably only works if the cause of the unrest is a magnesium deficiency.<br />Reportedly:<br />"With supplements, overdose is possible, however, particularly in people with poor renal function; occasionally, with use of high cathartic doses of magnesium salts, severe hypermagnesemia has been reported to occur even without renal dysfunction".<br />"Safety Issues<br />The US government has set the following upper limits for use of magnesium supplements:<br />Children<br />1-3 years: 65 mg<br />4-8 years: 110 mg<br />Adults: 350 mg<br />Pregnant or Nursing Women: 350 mg"<br />"It has been called nature's calcium channel blocker."<br />"Magnesium assists in calcium uptake, but it also competes with dietary calcium for the same absorption site in the intestine. Excessive dietary calcium (or phosphorus) is much more likely to block magnesium absorption than vice- versa in the typical American diet. Magnesium absorption is also inhibited by excessive dietary fat, phosphate, lactose, phytates and oxalates which form insoluble compounds with magnesium. Magnesium is also lost in diarrhea, long term use of diuretics, excessive sugar intake and protein malnutrition...<br />...  there are lower levels of minerals in food today due to depletion of the soil in modern farming methods. (23) Modern methods of milling, processing and the preservation of food cause nutrient losses, eg 85% of magnesium is removed from whole wheat in the milling."<br />Thus it is advisable to consult a qualified health care provider if a deficiency is suspected.<br />It's usually best to avoid deficiencies by a healthy diet: "Kelp is very high in magnesium, as are whole grains, almonds, and cashews..."

### Very tasty water
I have taste electrolite infused water once before and I loved it. I have no idea what the brand name was. This tasted the same. It literally makes me want to drink more. I have been scared off from drinking tap water as I have some auto-immune diseases and now qualfy as "older" (I hate that tag, elderly).<br /><br />We periodically receive reports from the city about what they find in our water. It says in the report that we should stop buying water. But it also has the warning about if you have an weakened immune system, are elderly, undergoing treatment involving steriods that you may be more vulnerable to certain protoza. Cryptosporidium is one that they warn against. It has been shown to be absent for several years and a person who has a weakened immune system should recover in two weeks. But the report also says the reason that the water doesn't taste well and look OK is because of algal bloom. Algal bloom can be bad for dogs and lambs so should I still drink it? I don't trust it so I don't.<br /><br /> When I tasted this water, it tasted so much better. All I can go by is taste. It tastes clean.<br /><br />I docked the rating by one star because of the cost. I still don't think I could afford it. I tried filters for a while but the filters were so expensive. If I could afford it I would definitely sign up for the subscribe and save.<br /><br />At least until it is gone, I can enjoy the water so clean tasting that I want to drink more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this water, it is so good that it is a treat to drink.

### I love the company, and like the product - but a few problems
I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in. This one is white cheddar pizza flavored, which I also liked.<br /><br />You can easily make these yourself at home in just a few minutes: Put a little oil (or Pam) on aluminum foil, sprinkle on some shredded hard cheese from the bag (Parmesan is the easiest and most widely available), and bake it in an oven for 5-10 minutes until it turns golden brown. A great serving size is 20-30 half-dollar sized parmesan bites/crisps, on a normal sized baking pan. A toaster oven or convection oven is best - it makes fewer servings, but will crisp faster (3-4 minutes on 400-450). And the great thing is, if you're a low carber who misses chips & dip, your homemade cheese crisps are easily dip-able in salsa, sour cream, etc.<br /><br />If you want to replicate the "Just the Cheese" flavor, take the package of powdered cheese from a box of "white cheese" flavored mac & cheese, and sprinkle it in. Therein lies the problem for me - wayyyy too much sodium. Cheese already has a lot of sodium. But add flavoring, and it can get overwhelming fast. After just one Just the Cheese bar, I have to guzzle a glass of water.<br /><br />So I have mixed feelings - I think this product is a genius idea. A convenient, single-serving bar of crispy cheese, to throw in your bag or glove box for a low carb snack. But I grade it down for 3 reasons:<br /><br />(1) Too much sodium. However, some of the other "plain" flavors have a bit less sodium.<br /><br />(2) Taste isn't always consistent. Sometimes you get a burned piece.<br /><br />(2) The price (over $1 per bar) is really too high for 1/2 ounce of cheese.  The Atkins & South Beach bars are much cheaper - usually 2.7-3.5 ounces (nearly 5-7 times more) for about the same price. I do not think this product should cost SIX TIMES what an Atkins bar costs.<br /><br />3.5 stars for me. If the company would fix these problems, I'd give it a 5.

### Gentlease has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula
A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals.  I have purchased Gentlease in different size cans and cases and am still using it with my twins.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.

### Almost Packaged To Well
I was extremely nervous about ordering a bonsai tree online. I was worried that it may not be packaged well enough, or that it may come in poor condition. However, I swallowed all my fears and finally decided to order this particular tree. When it arrived, it was packaged very well. There was no way that the tree could have moved or been shaken during shipping. It was almost packaged to well, and I almost cut the tree while trying to remove the tape around it. Health wise, the tree looked and felt very healthy. I have yet to see any health problems with it.<br /><br />Another benefit of ordering this tree, is that it comes with some extra bonsai supplies. The book, 101 Bonsai Tips, is a bit small and lacking in information. But what it does have is wonderfully informative. The trimmers of of excellent build quality, and can easily prune the leaves. Although I typically prune my Junipers with my fingers, the pruners are a nice accessories to have. I have not yet used the wire that came with it, but I have bent it around and played with it a little. It feels like it is of great quality, but I have yet to try it on a tree. Bearing in mind that all of these things come in addition to the tree, you know this is a great buy.<br /><br />If you are hesitant about ordering a bonsai tree online as I was, I assure you that this one is alright. I have no complaint about it. Also, the price of this package is extremely reasonable. I highly recomend ordering this Bonsai  pack if you are interested in starting Bonsai. If you are already a Bonsai master, but just want another tree, then this is also the one to get. I highly recomend it.

### Heavy, dark-roast taste, but it works pretty well
I usually avoid Starbucks coffees since I find them to be over-roasted to the point where the burnt or charcoal taste is all that comes through. That may work well if you put milk in your coffee, but if you drink it black it's not all that enjoyable.<br /><br />I saw this on the Amazon warehouse at a great price, so thought I'd give it a shot. Although this decaf Sumatra is also a dark roast, it works pretty well. The sweetness of the Sumatra beans are balanced by the dark roast, resulting in a heavy-body, earthy taste that is enjoyable when drunk black.<br /><br />My favorite decaf Sumatra remains the medium roast version from coffee bean direct (they also offer a dark roasted version on Amazon), but the Starbucks decaf Sumatra makes a decent cup. Not perfect, but better than I expected.

### Great water, don't know about health claims
There are a few things I do know, the normal PH for water is 7.0 when neutral. I also know that a ph of above 10 or below 3 will kill the fish in my pond. So I wouldn't recommend adding it to your goldfish bowl.<br /><br />But I have also read articles on the fact that our American diet leads to acidity, and we can help compensate by drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />So if you feel like this is a product that is helpful, this water tastes like water and does all of the same things water does. I drank a huge glass before bedtime, and sure enough, it got me up in the middle of the night. Interestingly, I did drop a full pound of water weight overnight as well, but I can't be sure it was caused by the water, although I will be repeating the experiment.

### Great chips but only good for kids lunches
These are great chips.  Anyone form the Eastern US can just run to the market and grab a bag, but us left-coasters are left longing for that very potato-ey taste of Wise Potato Chips.  Looking at the products offered by Wise on AMazon I thought that this product would be a great way to sample chips that I hadn't tried.  Since these said "Labeled for individual package sales" I thought that they would be a great size.  It turns out that these are the TINY bags that aren't sold in stores, they are stuck in your kids lunch bag.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - Wise chips are unreal-good.  I've made potato chips at home and the wise are THAT good.<br />But these packages are too small to even get more than a taste of the chip.<br /><br />Also, since the bags are so small, you aren't getting the actual full size of the potato chip - just a small version with not-quite-as-much burst in your mouth flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Great for kids lunch<br />Bad for enjoying a bag of Wise chips.<br /><br />I'm going to try the larger bags next, fingers crossed!

It was easy enough for him to install but he did need my assistance a few times to help hold some things in place. Looks great and works great.

### A bit too oily
It's a convenient way to get vegetables and it's healthy and vegan. I didn't like the amount of oil in it - too oily. I got tired of a tomato base soup too - but I eventually got through 2 cases. Some cans were dented, but we didn't get sick from them - but dents in food cans causes worry and concern.<br />I particularly liked the mushrooms in this. It was a little delight each time I got a mushroom in my mouth - just the right texture.<br />I hope Amy's is working on the BPA issue found in the lining of their (and most everybody else's) cans.

### Not as happy as I wanted to be
For our inaugural attempt at baking with almond meal, we used our old standby scone recipe, which results in 8 delicious but massively carby scones, light and fluffy.<br /><br />Substituting almond meal 1:1 (which was a total guess because there were no instructions on the bag about how to substitute) for the flour, we ended up with a very runny-ish dough.  I know it won't get as dough-like as wheat flour, but this was almost like cooked oatmeal, it was so runny.  So we ended up doubling the amount of flour, therefore, 2:1 ratio to regular flour, and the scones came out (a) crumbly and (b) salty.  I did add the regular amount of sugar to my recipe but it was apparently not enough to counteract the saltiness of the almonds.  Each of us choked down one scone with a lot of milk, and five more were tossed in the back yard for the birds.<br /><br />We will next attempt to make oatmeal-raisin cookies with it, and if that's as bad a fail, then we will not even bother with this product again.

### A bit watery, but impressive ingredients
With all the nonsense about pet food recalls and melamine, it's important to know where your pet food originates. This food does not originate in China and contains no wheat gluten. The chicken pot pie is a bit too watery to me so one star down. However, watery is not necessarily bad as it provides additional hydration for cats that eat dry food. All three of my cats do eat dry food (Nutro). I like to provide them with moist food on the side to encourage their appetite and hydration. I am frankly scared of most canned foods available because of the melamine thing. The cheap ones have ingredients almost always originating in China, and the expensive ones aren't cost effective for me to provide as a snack. This food does fill that gap in that it averages a dollar a can (through Amazon, less through subscribe and save) and it contains high grade (human grade) ingredients. I thought about putting my cats on a raw food diet (BARF for cats). It's messy, requires counter space, time and storage space for ingredients and the finished product. Therefore I try to get the best dry food I can and supplement it with canned food like this.<br /><br />All three cats liked both varieties of food. 3 cats = 2 cans once a day. The dry food is at will - they munch on that when they like. So far, so good. No increased mess in litter box from soupy ingredients, either. Their appetites remain strong for both this wet food and their dry food.

### HUGE savings if you don't use K-cups
My family uses the refillable baskets to make coffee in our Keurig Home Brewer. I found the K-cups weak and expensive and suspect most of them use dye to make the product look more like coffee.<br /><br />After about a year of heavy use, my $99.00 Keurig Home Brewer died and we decided it was crap. In the week since returning to our old drip pot methods, my family has gone through almost three times the coffee we were using with the home Keurig. I also miss the flavor of the machine's coffee. It turns out that steaming pressure gets more out of the beans than traditional coffee makers.<br /><br />At $10.00 a pound (we live in the Caribbean) for coffee, I reckon a new Keurig will pay for itself in TWO MONTHS.<br /><br />This morning's early trip to the store because we're no longer used to buying so much coffee prompted me to do the math and decide that I'll just keep ordering these coffeemakers and hope that soon, a more reliable model comes along.

### Works well, makes a nice bubbly drink
Basically it does just want it says.  Get a juice, any 100% juice with more than the required amount of sugar per serving, drop in the powder, place the supplied air seal on the bottle, and wait two days.  In return, you'll get a nice bubbly drink that tastes similar to mixing whatever juice you used with a hard cider.  I used white grape, and probably should have picked a hardier variant.  It would be a great drink for a party punch bowl (since it's relatively inexpensive per serving), or a hot summer day.<br /><br />One thing to note, when you've reached the desired fermentation, remove the yeast from the bottom.  If not, it will continue fermenting, even if you put it in the fridge.  I did this by pouring the juice on the top into a pitcher, and leaving the sludge in the bottom of the juice bottle.  Just wash it out, and put the juice back in, and you're set.<br /><br />Also, be sure to keep the airlock on the bottle once it's in the fridge.  Don't use the bottle cap!  Since the yeast is still doing its job, if you use the bottle cap, pressure will cause an explosion.

I remember these from my childhood and they are nearly impossible to find.  The flavor is delicate and sophisticated. You won't be left feeling like you just swallowed toothpaste and your breath won't smell like fruit or whatever else most chewing gum companies think smells fresh and lovely.  No.  You will smell like violets and the flavor of these candies has that unique taste.  If you've ever tasted a violet (pesticide free/organic), you will adore these.  and you won't have to worry about your little ones gobbling them down.  These are not made for little children and adult taste buds will be delighted while younger children will find the taste peculiar.

### Compared to Strong Lengths
I had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UW">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Strong Lengths Nourishing Conditioner</a>, which got fabulous results.  Total Care is also a good conditioner.  Like the rest of the Clear products I have tried so far, scent is not its forte.  Not that it's bad, it's just not memorable.<br /><br />What I look for is shiny, silky hair that doesn't break.  Although my hair continues to grow and look great, it hasn't gotten the accolades that it did with the previous conditioner.  I'm not really sure why, but it's obvious that something about Strong Lengths made people take notice.<br /><br />Other than the fact that people don't compliment my hair as much as they used to, I would have given this product five stars.  Because Strong Lengths gave me stronger applause, I'll give Total Care 4 1/2 stars.

### French Vanilla flavor??? Where is it?
I was expecting this coffee to have a stronger vanilla taste - to taste more like a French Vanilla cappuccino.  I could barely taste the vanilla.  I added a little white chocolate syrup and it helped bring out the vanilla flavor a little more.  If you want a definite vanilla flavor I would suggest passing on this one.  Luckily I tried one from a variety pack I got with our machine before I opened the whole box I bought.  I will be returning the box.

A warm, real vanilla breakfast cereal with a variety of crunchy textures ranging from flakes to puffs to crispies. Oh, did I mention REAL vanilla?? And organic?? AND....it's GLUTEN FREE! An amazingly tasty, organic, gluten free cereal! We are all entitled to our opinion, thus the variety of reviews. However, where a comparison was made between Special K (vitamins) and this cereal (lack thereof), I need to say that Special K is not organic. You can't really compare the two (again, just *my* opinion).<br /><br />This cereal rocks with soy milk, or if you really want an extra sweet treat, vanilla almond milk! We eat this straight up, right out of the box too. It's great as a little pick me up snack in the middle of the afternoon....anyway you eat Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise cereal, you can't go wrong.

### My dog's favorite toys
I have a 70lb male Doberman who is capable of destroying nearly every toy I've given him.  The Starmark Everlasting treat toys, including this Everlasting Treat Ball are indestructible.  He spends hours playing and chewing this toy.  Sometimes he opts to just lay down and lick the treats I put in it.  You can opt to not use the everlasting treats if you don't want to.  Just throw some other treats in the center and the dog will be happy.  It's also a big enough toy that won't roll under my couch.  A huge plus.  I also tried some of the different flavor treats and my dog loves them.  I can't say enough good things about the durability of this toy.<br /><br />Some people mentioned that the treats pop out too easily.  I've seen this happen before, and for some reason only happened when I first got the toy.  I'm not sure if the inside gets stickier over time, but the treats have only popped out prematurely for my dog, and I put it back in and haven't a problem since.

### Create product - hit or miss shipping
Found this same product for about $5 less at the Vitamin Shoppe website and bought it there.<br /><br />Even with their lowest price shipping, the Nutiva Coconut oil arrived quickly.  However, it opened during transit and leaked everywhere.  Called the customer service number and the gentleman who answered immediately wrote an order to send another shipment to replace my shipped spilled one and the replacement arrived quicker than the quoted time frame for the discount shipping.  This time, it was packed much better and didn't spill.  Seems I'm at least the second person to complain about how Vitamin Shoppe ships their coconut oil - hoping they'll ship it better next time so that they have more profit and I have more instant gratification.<br /><br />On to the product itself and the 5 stars it earns:<br /><br />Nutiva's extra virgin coconut oil has just a faint coconut smell and no taste.  It's liquid at 77°F and great inside and outside the human body.  Can't wait to saute veggies in it tomorrow!  Very psyched Nutiva markets this superfood and The Vitamin Shoppe sells it.

### Would have rated 5 stars a couple of months ago, but...
When I got my keeshond puppy about a year ago, I had trouble finding something that he would like to chew (that he was supposed to chew) until I discovered the wonderful world of "Bully Sticks".  My vet advised against nylabone (which didn't interest him at all anyway) and rawhide for puppies, so I let my pup browse the pet store shelves and his nose lead him to the Bully Sticks (any nose from afar could smell these out.)  I handed one to him and it was love at first bite.  They are quite expensive at the pet store, so I was thrilled to see them here on Amazon for such a bargain (compared to pet store prices.)  With all the hype about pets getting sick from products made in China, I was also happy to see that these Cadet Bull Sticks are made in Brazil... (though I know USA would be best.)<br /><br />On average, I've been buying 2 packages of these "Large 1 lb. Bull Sticks" a month for about a year.  At first, my puppy would take at least a whole day to consume one, and it was my sanity saver.  Any time I needed my pup to just chill out for a while, I'd give him one of these long Bully Sticks and he wouldn't want to do anything else until it was finished.  Yes, they do smell.  When you first open the package and if your dog is chewing it by your feet, you will definitely be surrounded by the fresh "pizzle" aroma.  Remember what these things are made of, though.  (It's what makes a bull, a bull. ;)  You also may not want your furry best friend to give you kisses while he's chewing it, but the smell does go away quickly and having my dog content and occupied is worth more to me than a brief "pizzle smell."  Because of their shape, they have not posed a choking hazard to my dog nor do they upset his tummy like many other things do.<br /><br />Now, if I had thought about writing a review on these Large Bull Sticks months ago, I would have given this product 5 stars.  I'm rating it 4 stars now because the last couple of recent batches I've gotten, have been very inconsistent in size...  most of them pieces around 6 - 8" long instead of 12" long, however, they do package them to equal out to be 1 lb. worth of bull sticks, albeit some are short and very thin, some are very short and thick, some are long and thick.  (Resisting inappropriate joke...;)  My other disappointment with these latest batches is that the price has gone up about $5 from earlier in the year, but it's still a nice value compared to the pet stores.  Like someone else has mentioned, they also don't seem to grab the attention of my now 14 month old, 45 lb. keeshond like they used to.  The last 2 batches, he'll leave it lying around awhile, but will finish it in about an hour when he does feel like chewing it.  I wonder if/what they changed at the manufacturer?  Though it's still a must-have for me in my arsenal of items to keep the dog busy.

### The favorite finger food.
I will say I prefer the taste of the Green Puffs to the Banana Puffs but they are also well received by my little one.  I think that the mix of banana and apple winds up a net neutral somehow.  As with most things, I would probably pick up a single canister to make sure that your little one is a fan before getting a pack.  They definitely "melt" in baby's mouth so my 8-month-old has no problem chewing them herself.  They are bigger and easier to grab than Cheerios so she is able to (and loves to) feed them to herself.<br /><br />I am soooooo happy that they use apple juice concentrate rather than other sweeteners.  They are the only puffs I've found that sugar or corn syrup or any other sweetener isn't the second ingredient.  They definitely taste like cereal (rice, oats and wheat are the first three ingredients).<br /><br />I have found that the containers I've purchased are always full (within an inch of the top, likely from settling), so I'm not sure where the reviewers that say the containers are too large are coming from - maybe they got a bad batch?<br /><br />Definitely, one of the best finger foods I've found so far.  Easy to grasp, light (3 puffs per calorie), no sugar, no syrups and all organic.
