I was sure skeptical at first, no carb no calorie noodles, sounded hard to believe.  My husband is diabetic so we are cutting out carbs and I gave these a try.  When I opened the package the smell was a little wierd but you rinse them off real good then you boil them and that smell goes away.  I used them in my stir fry and it was awesome, you couldn't tell they were not real noodles.  It reminds me of a rice noodle.  I will definitely be buying more soon.

### Love, love, love this flavor!
This is my favorite flavor out of all the coffee, teas and espressos for the Kaldi. I've tried them all more than a few times each to give them a relatively fair review, but this one tops my list. I do have to admit that I prefer espresso drinks over coffee and teas, so take that into consideration.<br /><br />The Italian espresso is smooth, bold and full of flavor, but doesn't leave a bitter after-taste. The other two espresso flavors leave a taste in your mouth where it feels like something's missing.<br /><br />My favorite espresso drink is an iced latte, and this makes the perfect latte. Two shots of the espresso with about 6 ounces of milk makes my perfect drink!<br /><br />Out of the three caffeinated espressos, the Italian tops the list for flavor, then the Premium and lastly the Continental.

### Amazingly fast & great taste.
It really only took 60 seconds-REALLY! Other noodle dinners I have tried take 3 or more minutes (and then once they're cooked enough, you have to wait until they cool enough to eat). So if you have a half hour for your lunch hour, this is a great choice. The packaging is really ingenious.<br /><br />We recently had a Barilla sauce from a jar at home that I thought was a bit bland; but this was good. Tomato and a touch of red-pepper heat.<br /><br />Also in its favor is the fact that it is all natural. The fewer ingredients, the better & there aren't a lot here. 320 calories & 29% of the sodium you need in a day (so it's not perfect...but I'd really rather have the all natural than a chemical cocktail that has fewer calories).<br /><br />It IS a little expensive. Nearly 6$ per if you purchase here...strangely the Barilla Mezze Penne with Tomato and Basil Sauce is less than 4$...so save money with that one! It's probably just as good!

I grew up eating Red Vines and I liked them very much, but it's been ages and ages since I've eaten licorice.

No way were we going to feed it to our dog. Something was clearly wrong.<br /><br />We've been buying Newman's Own dog food for the last two years (since we got a dog) and never experienced anything like this. Interesting to look back at the reviews here and see three from the April - May timeframe that sound like there may have been similar issues for others around the same time we made our purchase.  Guessing there must have been a production run that resulted in contaminated product. We've reported the issue to both Newman's Own and the FDA.

### Tastes good but not sure what to do with powdered granola.
Pros: I appreciate that these grains are healthy and high in fiber.  It's also good that they are all natural, gluten-free, without GMO.  Nice sugar to fiber ratio.  Not too sweet.  Would be great as a yogurt topper if I ate much yogurt.<br /><br />Cons: The bag says clusters, but what I received was closer to powder.  There may have been a handful of clusters in the entire bag.  If they had been clusters, they would have made better snacks for the grandchildren.  What I had instead were granola sprinkles.  The cinnamon flavor was okay.  Also, the granola has a nutty, oily smell.  It isn't bad, per se, just unusual.  Too expensive in my opinion.<br /><br />I think I would like to try the blueberry and the peanut butter.

### Marley Coffee is tasty but needed a lot of trial and error to make it
I selected Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count based solely on a five sentence blurb in the amazon.com/VINE offering to me in its monthly newsletter to sample and to review. There were no instructions on how to prepare the brew. I did not worry. I expected the shipped coffee to contain enough instructions on arrival. It did not.<br /><br />If, however, I had gone to the non-VINE website of Amazon I would have received a clue how to brew the coffee: "Directions<br />For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers."<br /><br />I don't own a "single server home coffee pod brewer," so the test was going to prove difficult at best, although I did not think so at the time.<br /><br />Then came in the mail an attractively packaged, colorful cardboard box, full of small print texts extolling various aspects of the product with Lion of Judah logo, photo of a Rastafarian man and a statement from musician Bob Marley about how he had founded his organic coffee and tea company as a tribute to his father who had come from Nine Mile, Jamaica.<br /><br />Very instructive. But no brewing instructions anywhere. I scissored open the air-sealed plastic cover for one of the 15 small pods enclosed of ground coffee. No instructions.<br /><br />Here are the various ways I went about making Marley coffee:<br /><br />(1) Were these 15 like similar pods I had seen in motels with DIY coffee makers?Where you toss pods in a plastic  filter and add hot water into the back of the machine. Then throw a switch. Expect two cups of coffee to emerge. So I scissored open four plastic bags, detecting in the process a beyond faint aroma that I had years earlier come to associate with kidneys for breakfast in bed and breakfasts in Ireland. I tossed four pods into my Mr. Coffee Machine<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041847R4">Mr. Coffee CG12 12-Cup Switch Coffeemaker, White</a> and added enough water in my to make eight cups of coffee. No paper filter. Result: tasty, several ingredients detected. Very weak!<br /><br />(2) After discussion with my wife, I next decided to make a mere two cups of coffee using only two pods in Mr. Coffee, this time placing a paper filter beneath the pods. Same initial urine smell. Same good taste. Stronger.<br /><br />(3) Still my wife and I, in the absence of written instructions, decided there must be a simpler, cleaner way. We next treated a pod as if it were a single serving tea bag -- minus a string. We therefore put one pod in a coffee mug and poured boiling water over it. Same Irish kidneys smell. Decent taste when done. Rather a mess, however, fishing out the pod with a spoon.<br /><br />Bottom line: even when weak, Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, 15-Count offered a strikingly better than average taste. I would drink it again if only I had the right equipment.<br /><br />-OOO-

### This is SO GOOD!!!
Not only does it taste wonderful but it fills your house with an amazing aroma.  The  rice cooks up into dark reddish brown fat chewy grains.  I make it in a pot as directed or in the microwave.  Both methods turn out great.  My microwave is medium power (I can't find the tag that says exactly what wattage it is) and I use a ceramic casserole with ceramic lid, roomy enough to allow for the bubbling rice and water and not leak out.  Put in one cup of rice and two cups of water (I add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon or so of olive oil but you don't have to) then cook on high for five minutes.  Leave it in the oven undisturbed and cook on medium for 45 minutes more.  Let it sit at least fifteen minutes before removing the lid.  This rice will be a staple in my cupboard from now on.  A batch of rice makes a complete meal of just about anything, especially leftover veggies and/or fish.

### Crunchy? Maybe. Nutty? Nope.
I am in awe of the reviewers who were able to see - much less taste - the nuts in Kellogg's Golden Honey Nut Crunchy Nut cereal.  They must have far better palates than I do, because to me these taste exactly like Frosted Flakes, if Frosted Flakes used honey.  Were I blindfolded, I wouldn't be able to tell you that there were supposed to be nuts in this cereal at all.  In fact, a blindfold wouldn't be needed given how tiny the peanut pieces are. For a cereal that has the word "nut" in it's name twice, I expected more.<br /><br />Overall, this cereal is fine.  Frosted Flakes (its closest cousin) are the sweet sibling of Corn Flakes, one of the most classic cereals out there.  It's hard to go totally wrong with that type of lineage. Still, it's hardly nutty, and given that's its claim to fame, I can't recommend it.

### Road Trip Companion
I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.  When I got the samples from Marley Coffee, my first reaction was the socially responsible credos listed on the box.  Nothing wrong with that but if the coffee isn't good, the good deeds don't matter to me.  After tasting it, I found that the coffee IS good.  The blend I received was "Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe" and it is very enjoyable.  The coffee is packaged in individually sealed coffee in their own filter packets.  Having an ample supply at home of other good coffee (and after enjoying a weekend of Marley Coffee) I decided that this was the coffee to take on the road.  I have been using motel coffee makers for years with the ground coffee I took with my wife and I.  We even bring our own measuring spoons and filters.  Alas, the motel coffee-makers have shrunk in size and I can't make a good job of making my own coffee.  These packets are just the right size for those dinky coffee-makers so I'm taking Marley Coffee on the road.  In fact, I did just that last weekend.  I even threw an extra packet in my coat pocket.  Good thing too because I had put the other packets in a different bag which left me with the local mediocrity.  Why the long story?  Well, the quality of coffee was the difference of night and day and I made sure I now have ample packets in all my travel bags.  It's that good.

But they ain't cheap (here in Vancouver they're usually around $3.99/100g!) So when I stumbled across this 10lb bag of organic goji berries by Navitas at a very reasonable price, I couldn't resist! Having already become a fan of Navitas' Maca powder I figured I couldn't go wrong, right? ;)<br /><br />Well, Navitas did not disappoint! They arrived very securely packaged in thick sealed plastic bags. And the taste? Awesome! Unlike another reviewer, mine were soft and sweet with a nice chew! I'm so thrilled! What a bargain!

### Nice antler, my dogs aren't interested
As others have noted, this thing is huge.  If your dog likes it, it could be a good investment, because it's clearly indestructible and could last forever.  It has great ridges and shapes, things dogs usually like to chew on.  So why three stars?  My dogs don't chew it.  I have three dogs and one foster dog, of different sizes and breeds, so I'm surprised that not one of them likes it.  Especially since they loved deer antlers, which I stopped giving them because I had problems with splintering.  One dog - who will chew anything - nibbled on the edges a few times to get at the "marrow," but gave that up when it was clear that there was only so much marrow you could get.<br /><br />This seems like a good product IF your dog likes it, but in my house, four dogs say "meh." $30 down the drain.

### Worthwhile treats
At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

The sauce does have some kick, but if you like spicey treats, this probably will rate 'medium' for you as far as a level of hotness.

### Good crunch and not too sweet
I like these bars because you get the crunch and flavor of a nut bar without too much sugar. They are peanut-y, without the weird texture and gross sweetness of other peanut butter protein bars. In my mind these are positives.<br /><br />Be prepared that there is not likely to be a large amount of chocolate coating on any given bar. The first time I bought one, I was disappointed when I opened it and compared the appearance of the actual bar to the picture on the packaging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the taste so I decided to buy more.<br /><br />They can sometimes leave an impression of being a bit dry or gritty, which I suppose is due to the soy crisps or tapioca starch, or maybe just how dry my own mouth happens to be that day. I simply make sure I have a glass of water available when I plan to eat one of these.

### 5 star rating
I would truly recommend this brand to anyone with a cat. My cat had a ton of problems - from vomitting to diarrhea and really smelly poop. Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!

### Not so mini! Pomeranian not impressed at all!
I rarely give 1 star reviews, but how do you rate it higher if it does...nothing?<br /><br />First of all, I was a little surprised by how large these "mini-Congos" are.  We have an 8-pound Pomeranian and the only reason I chose these is because of the word, "mini".<br /><br />The "mini-Congo" is a full inch in roundness and about 3.5" long.  When you go to the pet store and buy "mini" treats, they are about the size of a matchbook or so.  This seriously looks like something for a medium-large sized dog.  I can only imagine a regular "congo" is enormous, heh.<br /><br />But all dogs love bones and they all love to chew on something, right?  Well our Pomeranian is not impressed.  He looked at it, licked it for a little bit and left it alone.<br /><br />We also give him these "dental sticks" and he hates them (well he doesn't devour them like he does a real treat).  He will lick them and put them away for awhile and if we don't give him any treats for a couple days, he'll go ahead and eat the dental stick.<br /><br />Well it's been over a week now and he won't go near the "mini-Congo" treat at all, in fact he'd rather go eat the "dental stick" he doesn't like.<br /><br />So it is confirmed, our dog simply does not like these, plus he can't even put his bite around it to begin with.  Caution - these are not so "mini" for your "mini" dog like our Pomeranian.<br /><br />Two paws down says Chocco.

### Taste better than you would expect
So, I tend to eat gluten free so I like trying new products. Some gluten free products are amazing, and most are not. These don't seem like much by themselves, but they are pretty good with a nice sauce. It definitely isn't anything on its own. It has zero flavor, but it has a pretty nice texture with a stir fry or in a soup if you don't want anything too heavy.<br /><br />I did an experiment and tried a stir fry with peanut sauce and tried it with brown rice and also these brown rice noodles. I thought for sure the rice would taste better. The rice had a more grounding dense texture, but when I tried the noodles I was pleasantly surprised. They were fluffy and airy and didn't overpower the food, they just complemented it. So if you want something less filling than rice, or more healthy than white rice noodles you will like these.<br /><br />Just a note, these are very thin like angel hair pasta, not vermicelli. Also, the directions say to put in lukewarm water for one minute. That wasn't nearly enough. They needed to be in hot water for about 6 minutes. At least that was my experience.

This formula totally saved us during the transition from nursing. My third had strong allergies to soy and dairy and when we discoved this fabulous product we were totally relieved. He loves the taste and is still asking for it at 2 1/2 years old. The ingredients have been carefully chosen and I appreciate the high nutritional value and clean product list. For moms just trying it out, be patient as the babies take a few tries to get used to the texture. we have really relied on this product and highly recommend it.

### Marley Coffee Pods
I got this for my husband, and he drank a few of these pods, and has yet to use anymore. I think this coffee is too weak, so less water is recommended. Thanks for the free sample, it's fun trying new things. This isn't the best of coffee's yet it's worth a try. Update: I cut up five packets, and put it in a five cup filter, with full amount of water, and the coffee brewed perfectly and tasted really good. I tried this instead of using the one shot packets, and it worked for me.

### I am SO in love with these chips!
I have tried both the pinto bean and black bean chips, and I love them both. :D The black bean ones are my favorite... they are PERFECT with hot sauce, or hummus, or refried beans... whatever I have tried them with, they are good. I like them way better than corn chips now. The taste is incredible! The only time you *might* want to use something different is if you are wanting to use them with a very thick/hard dip, because these chips are thinner than corn chips and might break while you're scooping. Not that I mind... when my dip is full of crumblies, I just eat the rest of it with a spoon. :-p<br /><br />Oh and they have lots of fiber too, in addition to being corn-free, gluten-free, low-glycemic, and all that other good stuff. :D

### A Satisfying Snack
I bought this product for a sugar-free chocolate indulgence.  The nibs are O.K. plain but become a very satisfying on-the-go snack when combined with coconut or goji berries.  Organic Nectars are less bitter than another brand I have tried.  They also have much fewer hard pieces of shell than the other brand.  Some may not like nibs because they are not sweet.  I compare the difference in eating nibs vs. milk chocolate to the difference in drinking a good red wine vs. grape juice.  I do occasionally have Lindt's Excellence 85% cocoa as a delicious alternative.<br />The fact that the nibs are organic is a plus.

### Excellent machine for the price.
This popcorn is very convenient and tastes great.  The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.<br /><br />I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.<br /><br />There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.<br /><br />This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.  Yum!

A great new addition to my coffee line up.

### Love It
I'm a huge fan for cinnamon. The taste, the smell, and the sight is enough to make my mouth water. I purchased this cinnamon oil for no other reason but to have some delicious cinnamon oil at home. If you're worried about wasting your money on weak cinnamon oil, then you should definitley have no worries with this stuff. After seeing the reviews and how people make cinnamon toothpicks, I decided to do it too. Let me tell you, after washing my hands (with soap) then doing the dishes, my fingers still smelled (and tasted) like cinnamon! This stuff is really strong, and the toothpicks will just about burn a hole in your lip if you leave it sitting there. These toothpicks are great to carry in a mint tin to use after a large, garlic/onion meal. And since it's pure cinnamon oil and not candy or gum with sugars, its great for your teeth, digestive system, and breath without leaving a nasty aftertaste. All in all, this is great oil; a bit pricey but worth it. Also, the oil you soak the toothpicks in can be resused over and over again, as long as the container is sealed shut; so I can see this oil lasting for a very long time.

### delicious.
I got a variety pack of Sahale mixes, and this was the only one i liked. The others just didn't work for me, though i only actively disliked one (sing buri, my coworkers all hated it too, though they gladly ate the other flavors i dismissed).<br /><br />For the reviewer who said it was too peppery, either they're extremely sensitive to black pepper, they got a badly mixed bag, or by chance grabbed a bit that was more peppery than the rest and didn't explore further. I think the pepper is perfect, strong enough to give it a little kick and sting, but light enough that it's not the primary (or even secondary) flavor. There is some variability, though, and once in a while you'll get a mouth full of pepper.<br /><br />While i gladly eat these for a snack at my desk at work, they are a must-have for long plane trips. The nuts make it filling, and the cranberries and glaze give it a nice sweet touch without being so sugary that i get the jitters trapped in a middle seat on hour 2 of a cross-country flight.

### Tasty but the chewy isn't very appealing.
I honestly think Chantea could solve all their problems with a clear label.<br />The tea itself is actually pretty good but the label is opaque and covers up the fact that there are small chunks of Aloe or something floating in the top of the bottle. I shook it up, cracked the bottle, took a big swig and nearly spit it out.<br />It's not so much that the chunks tasted bad it was that I had no idea they were there. On top of that they were kind of slimy. I honestly didn't like the texture of them. I drink coconut water with chunks in it all the time, love it, but these chunks were just kinda weird to me.<br />So when I took that first swig and got a mouthful of unexpected slime chunks. Well it sullies the experience.<br /><br />Here's the thing, the tea is really good. Not too sweet not to bitter, once I got past the chunks I really liked it. It was very refreshing.<br />I guess I shoulda poured it into a glass or something first but I'm assuming the average consumer is just going to crack the bottle and start chugging.<br />Just brace yourself for the goo chunks. ;)

### Particular Puss Loves this Food!
So, I have a HUGE cat (not fat, just laaarge) who has never had issues with being choosy about cat food until this past year. She'd kind of pick at a food for a week or so, then just completely stop. Getting her to eat consistantly has been a huge battle, and I've been worried because she's been losing weight which is not good on her gigantic Maine Coon self.<br /><br />I don't have much money, but finally did the math and figured out that buying cheaper food and then throwing half of it away wasn't saving me anything...invested in the Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken cat food. It came a few days ago, and I think the year of struggling to find something Beatrix will eat is finally over. She LOVES this food. She's taken to lounging by the bowl and casting pitiful looks of longing at me whenever its not on hand! lol She's happy, so I'm happy. And its no lie that this is human quality food. I haven't actually eaten any of it, cause...well...yuck, but it looks like better quality than the chicken you get at KFC! lol Plus, and this is big because I live in a small apartment...there is almost NO odor to it like most wet cat foods...just smells slightly chickeny.<br /><br />I've also noticed that her tummy seems to be bothering her less if the litter and furball issues are a good indicator. Good food = happy cat. Give it a whirl.

Now here's the thing, I'm a huge fan of imported Italian hard salami. As a sandwich meat, a pizza topping or appetizer, there's not much better as far as I'm concerned. Now domestic brands are a different story. My experience with them had been uniformly bad, until now. This Bridgford Hard Salami is excellent. Not just OK, but stands up well compared to any of the imported Italian meats I've tried. If you like salami, this stuff is the real thing.
