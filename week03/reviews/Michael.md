### Delicious beef jerky
This is my favorite beef jerky.  I eat it for a protein snack after working out and it's very satisfying- high protein, low calories, and no preservatives or nitrites.  It's also cheaper or the same cost as other beef jerkies that are worse for you.  I have a subscription and plan to continue it for a while.

### Don't fall prey to fads and anecdotal reviews
I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health. I saw the negative review and talked to my vet about it. I've also asked a number of veterinary professionals what to feed my cats and they all answer the same thing: Science Diet. Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.

### Great Alternative To Other Diet and Regular Sodas
I love Zevia Ginger Rootbeer! I thought it might have a bitter aftertaste like other diet soft drinks but it didn't. I started drinking it because I am watching my carbs and sugar grams but like a good rootbeer once in a while. I wanted to be able to have one without a lot of sugar and without artificial sweeteners. I'm so glad I found out about this one. It hits the spot every time.<br /><br />This past weekend I took a sip of regular rootbeer and didn't care for it because I'm used to Zevia ginger rootbeer and prefer it. My husband enjoys it too and he's not watching his sugar or on a weight loss plan. He just likes the taste.<br /><br />I didn't think we'd work our way through our 24 cans so quickly. I'm looking forward to our next shipment.

### I thought they were bland
Yes, I did try one. They taste very bland, actually, to me they had very little flavor. But my rabbits and the dog love them. Kind of expensive but if you get them at the $1 per bag rates you are getting a big bargain even with the shipping and handling. I actually ordered some treats from a different business that sells bunny treats and found it was this same product repackaged, a smaller amount in the bag and a bigger price. So I checked Amazon and found that the identical items were sold as doggie treats in a bigger bag and less cost. On top of that nice savings (I don't have a car at the moment so I can't drive to the pet store)the animals fight each other to be first in the handout line. I wish I could get the recipe for them. And, I'd like to buy them in a 5lb bag. Does anyone sell them that way? They'd make a nice doggie Christmas present.

### Great green tea for not too much.
Stash's gunpowder green has been a staple tea in our house for almost a year now. We prefer it iced, but it is decent hot. It is much more affordable than most other green teas and the quality is right up there with other good gunpwder greens we have had. Like most green teas, steep at 180 degrees for 3 minutes to get the best results. We go through a 3 pack of this stuff every single month.

### My cats best friend
I was looking for a cat food without grains, and read the reviews on this line of cat food. So I took a chance and ordered it hoping my cats would like it. YES they do. I have 2 male cats one 12 yrs and one 7 yrs. The 7 year old has IBS and vomits most cat food up. He has not vomited this up once. (YEAH!) My older cat eats this and leaves most of the Fancy Feast I put in their bowls. I am so glad I found this as I believe that the grains and fruits they put in cat food is not good for them.

### Great Taste for any Chocolate lover!
I discovered the Monin Sugar Free Dark Chocolate sauce at a local frozen yogurt place.  I am currently on a weight loss diet and have a No Sugar Added / Non-Fat yogurt occasionally.  This Sugar Free syrup really makes the usual Vanilla Frozen yogurt a real gourmet treat.<br /><br />I purchased it and found that it works great in turning plain coffees into yummy mocha's. Add it to your milk and heat it slightly, then whip it to make a really tasty mocha latte.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because it is sweetened with Maltitol, a "sugar alcohol" which can upset your stomach if you're sensitive, but I haven't had the problem, but I think if you use enough it can force frequent trips to the bathroom, if you know what I mean.  If it was sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) then it would get 5 stars from me.<br /><br />I look forward to trying their other flavors as this was a winner... I have since re-ordered in the "6-pack."  It is also available in a larger size bottle that you can use a hand pump to dispense.<br /><br />I recommend it for any chocolate lover who is looking to top ice cream, yogurt, even coffee drinks!

### From a recovering Diet Mountain Dew addict
Last year, I was drinking probably two 24 packs of Diet Mountain Dew a week. I thought this was rather unhealthy (and expensive), so I decided to gradually taper off. I had decided to steer clear of all types of pop, but while at Sunflower Market, I noticed Zevia. I liked that it was sweetened with stevia, rather than something a little more artificial. I allow myself a maximum of one Mountain Zevia a day, if that. It has helped me rid myself of a pretty bad DMD addiction.

I have been eating ONLY Flahavan's brand for about 4 years. I noticed by accident as well, in Wegman's, and now nothing else will do! I just went online to order directly from the Flahavan's site in Ireland since Wegman's just discontinued selling it......not enought of us true Irish porridge eaters I guess. I was excited to see Amazon sells it. It is the best/quickest method when done in the microwave. I do the 1/2 cup porridge to 1 cup 1% milk, nuking for 2:15 minutes [make sure you use a deep bowl, as directed] and it's sensational.....creamy, hearty, great flavor.  I add walnuts, Splenda, and sometimes raisins or sugar-free Log Cabin if I'm in the mood. Even if you're not an oatmeal afficionado, try this.......good for you, and soooooooo yummy too.

### Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat.<br />My baby girl loves "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison mainly.<br />I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains.<br />But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for "Salmonella"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled too.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying.

They are a nice break from the same-old corn chips and all of my guests who have tasted this product find them to be tasty and interesting.

### Yummy butter for "allergic" people
This cashew butter tastes great, and its one of the few I can eat that's on the market because of my food allergies.  The label says:  "Made in a facility that processes Tree Nuts and Soy, but DOES NOT process any Peanuts, Gluten, Dairy, Cholesterol, or GMO's."  I also have a problem with Soy and I don't usually buy products if the label says "may contain soy" or "facility also processes soy", but I trust the Artisana brand and decided to try it.  I've never had a problem with - except for wanting to eat too much of it!  Plus its raw and organic too.  It has a nice consistency, and you don't have to refrigerate this (although you may need to if you don't eat it up as fast as we do).  Its a pricy product, but a "clean" one and Amazon's price is similar to what I've seen locally and online.

### Medora Popcorners White Cheddar
I, too, think they taste a little strange-kind of sour-ish. They have a very unpleasant smell when a bag is first opened, but I think this is from the bleu cheese powder. After a few chips, the taste sort of grows on you, if you can ignore the almost-like-dirty-socks-smell. I probably will not order this brand again. I think Popchips taste much better, but I tried these because Popchips were more expensive. Sometimes you do get what you pay for. Not terrible, not great-just so-so.

### KIND of okay, actually
I'm a granola eater, big time. Bars, trail mix, thins, cookies, whatever, put granola in it, I'll eat it. I'd never had the opportunity to try the KIND brand, so I was glad to give this stuff a try. Right out of the package, I liked the cinnamon-sugar aroma and flavor, and I found the granola itself to be crunchy and tasty, without being overly sweet, cloying, or cereal-like. With the various seeds and quinoa mixed in, this was more like trail mix or cereal than clusters, but I didn't especially have a problem with it. I've heard flax seeds are healthy for you and I'd never had them before. For the most part, I'm okay with them, but some of the seeds don't break apart easily once they are in your mouth, and I had more than a few husks and hulls get stuck between my teeth and gums. Personally, I wasn't too happy about that, but other than that, taste was decent, texture was good, (this does make a nice texture enhancer in yogurt), and it appears to be higher protein and lower calorie than your average granola. So, this KIND snack is nothing outstanding and nothing terribly bad, earning a middle-of-the-road rating as an average-but-not-special product.

Great concept, especially since all my local groceries have stopped stocking the Senseo pods in favor of more K-cups.  These do NOT fit the filter holder of the Hamilton Beach Personal Cup machines.  My son, the teenage engineer, attempted to modify one by trimming the rim down; now it almost fits.  I do NOT recommend this product if you have the Hamilton Beach.

### Half the calories of regular and is AWESOME !!!!
Disregard that bad review.  This has pepper in it and it's a bit spicy but so worth it.  I mean, if you don't like pepper, why would you buy it?  This is great for anyone watching calories or on Weight Watchers since it's 1/2 the calories of regular mayo but still it's all natural and much better than regular.  Use to make chicken salad, put some on chicken and broil or pan "fry."  A little goes a long way so you get all the pleasure of mayo with none of the guilt.<br /><br />I want to marry this product I love it so much!

### Best crunchy granola bar!
I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks. I find that I need something with me in case I get hungry. Fruit doesn't travel well. Granola bars do well in my bag. But chewy bars get too sticky. And most crunchy granola bars are so hard I am always worried I would lose a tooth or two. I saw these at Nutrition S'mart yesterday and picked them up. I tried one before I got home. They have a great crunch, not too hard, and a wonderful flavor. Now I want to try the other flavors but my local Nutrition S'mart only had 2.

### Berry-licious!!
I always hated the after taste of drinks with artificial sweeteners, but this stuff is different even though it is sweetened with Splenda.  The box says to mix with 16 oz of water, but I find that mixing it with 20 oz is less tangy.  These things contain caffeine and several B vitamins, therefore you feel an energy boost after drinking them.  The best of all is that each 20 oz serving is only 5 calories, vs the 140 calories in each cola pop that i used to drink.

My husband is over seas and pick these for Valentine's Day for me, don't get me wrong I love roses and its the thought that counts, But they looked nothing like the pictures. They were squeezed into a box and the colors were not the same as shown. Not only that the roses had thorns on them that had not been cut, and basically your not getting what you pay for here. BAD deal!!! But the roses that were in the boxes after doing another person's job they are lovely now!!!!

This is darn good coffee! I wound up ripping open the individual packets and just poring the grounds into filters for my regular drip coffee maker. But it's a nice rich flavor anyway, especially for pre-ground. And what a cool package! I mean, who doesn't like Bob Marley? Plus it says right on the box "organic, ethically farmed," which I'm inclined to believe; somebody's gotta check on that stuff, right? Holy recommended.

After years of using Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee Pods I suddenly found it difficult to purchase them from several supermarkets where I shop.

### Product is barely edible & packages do not include the amount advertised.
The quantity information on this product is inaccurate. The ad says each bag is 1.5 ounces, (even 1.75 ounces per bag, if you read further on the description), but it has actually been downsized to 1.2 ounces.<br /><br />For the case of 12 that I bought I received a full 3.6 ounces less than was advertised. Customers have a right to know how much product they are getting when they order. Although I have informed them of this error they still have not changed the promotion to read the correct 1.2oz. Buyer beware.<br /><br />Edit: I didn't realize while I was complaining about the downsizing that they also changed the formula. The product is less crunchy, almost stale, and far more crumbly than before. I am removing my subscription to this product.

My husband and I both enjoy this product.  We usually have it a couple of times a month and use it on chicken.  Just follow the dirctions on the package which is very simple.  While it's baking in the oven, fix some rice and a quick vegetable.  Dinner is served.  If you use boneless chicken, watch your baking time.  Very tasty product and Amazon has it at an excellent price.

### Excellent product (a little tweaking makes it better).
I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using.

### Not impressed
I probably would have liked these better had I not followed the directions on the package.  I've had quite a lot of brown rice pasta, and this one was fairly neutral, flavor-wise.  It generally took on the flavor of what I cooked with it.  The texture was bothersome.  Again, had I cooked them more in water and NOT followed the directions on the package, the texture may have been better.  As it was, after soaking them for the requisite minute, they came out like straw.  It only went downhill when I put them in the skillet.  They began to breakdown to mush immediately.  There are other brown rice pasta products, even very fine ones such as this one, (Annie Chun's Maifun comes to mind) that will hold up to cooking and handling.  From a gluten-free standpoint this pasta is a thoughtful gesture.  That's about all it has going for it.  I don't recommend it at all.

### Chocolate Lovers Drink
I used to drink Ghirardelli Chocolate Mocha hot chocolate as a treat on weekend mornings when I was working.  I'm now retired and started drinking it every day.  I was afraid that I would get tired of it drinking it every day instead of just as a treat.  Well, that didn't happen at all.  I am now what I would call addicted to it.  I have it every morning with my toast and my GMA on TV.  I recently went to my mother's place for several days and truly missed my favorite morning drink.  I couldn't wait to have it the morning after I got home.  Next time I'm going to be gone for several days I'll make sure I take a canister with me.  I love that I've found this product on Amazon and even that I have to opportunity to have it via automatic shipment.  I started having trouble finding it in the stores we shop so the automatic shipment it great.

### No effect for either me or my husband
My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.<br /><br />I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer.

### Incredibly smooth, soothing coffee
I loved it even as I opened the package to be greeted by my first whiff of amazing vanilla. Finely ground, it is roasted to avoid all bitterness and succeeds! Smooth drinking and aromatic after brewing in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037ZG3DS">Mr. Coffee BVMC-PSTX91 Optimal Brew 10-Cup Thermal Coffeemaker</a>. Clear instructions should be followed - 2 tsp per 6 oz of water for best results. Small, vacuum sealed, bags mean your coffee won't go stale before you can enjoy it all - and the old-style bend tab closure works well to seal on the fly. I'm definitely hooked and want to try other Melitta coffees now.

I and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we'd seen suggested online, but noticed no effects whatever.

### Not recommended after they changed their formula
I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).

### Limited Ingrediant Diet wroks as described.
After doing a lot of research on foods for dogs with allergies, I happened upon this brand, and flavor in particular for its positive reaction for so many other dogs with allergies.  I have to say it has worked wonders for my dog.  Her regular itching, diarrhea, etc. occurrences that the vet could never figure out, and were just treated with various antibiotics,  were essentially cured with this food.  I also use the same formula for her treats as well.  That's it, no other ingredient types.  I'm very satisfied so far.  My only complaint is no local stores stock the smaller bite sin the larger bags.<br /><br />Just a note: I recommend this size even for 30-40 lb dogs.  The larger pieces are VERY hard and were a bit difficult for my dog to chew.<br /><br />The only con to this formula is that your dog WILL be going #2 more often.  It is sweet potato after all.  Mine went from typically twice, but no more, to guaranteed three times a day.  However her allergies are under control and she is happy eating the food so that is all that matters to me.

### Excellent for good health of cat
After a year on kitten food, one of my two cats began to get rather chubby.  He had a hard time hauling himself up onto one of the cat perches in the house.  We switched to this food when they hit their one-year birthday, and my little chubby cat began to lose weight.  Now, a year later, the indoor cat formula is all they eat, and my cat can jump up to the top bunk of the cat perch with no problems at all.  He has an all-star physique.  I do have to say, they preferred the kitten food too at first, but when given no other options, they eat this food with no problems.  If you look at the nutritional content of the food, indoor cat formula has very little fat, while kitten food is quite high in it.  Oh, and I've also seen *maybe* one hairball in the last year.  Not bad.
