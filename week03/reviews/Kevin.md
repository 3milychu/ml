### Package states may have wheat!!
Now come on, why does sugar have to be processed on the same equipment as wheat?  Happy it is organic, happy that it is whole cane, but with a family member allergic to wheat, this is a PROBLEM!!!  Same thing just recently happened with our favorite olive oil, except with nuts and soy.  Let us know the major allergens that it is contaminated with, so we will not buy it unnecessarily.

### I question its value
My two dogs do love this product.  The dumb one found it confusing for only a few seconds, and then began licking it happily.<br /><br />The product is physically similar to roll-on deodorant.  The plastic ball works well, and will last the duration of the product.<br /><br />The product doesn't last very long in my experience.  Because the dog is not getting anything to chew, and you are not reaching into a bag of treats, I think most will see a tendency to let the dog get several good licks in.<br /><br />If you're very interested in weight loss without loosing rewards, I suppose this is a clever solution.  Otherwise, this simply is not the best value compared to many other options.

### Tasteless grit that almost broke a tooth
I eat a lot of healthy food and am willing to try new ones.  So recently I tried this cereal.  The only plus I can report is that it had a lot of raisins in it.  Which is a good thing because, without the raisins it would have been completely tasteless.  But the worst thing about it is that it contains some very hard bits that almost broke a tooth.<br /><br />That was my experience the first time, eating it cold with milk.  I noticed that the box suggested it could also be eaten warm...I figured that heating it with milk might soften the hard bits, so I decided to try it (I was also trying desperately to avoid throwing away the $5.49 investment).  My theory was wrong.  The hard bits are un-softenable.  I dumped the rest of the box of cereal...and $5.49 + tax...in the compost bin.

### Great deal
These Backyard BBQ Kettle Chips were a great deal with the promo code.  It was nice to have a larger size bag.  Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!

### High Quality Corn Masa Flour
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000IJYK4">Maseca Corn Flour, 4.4 lbs.</a> is the real thing for making delicious tortillas.  The only other ingredient necessary is water. Of course, a huge amount of technique is required!  My son-in-law uses it to thicken his wonderful chili.  He gave me the recipe, which I placed in Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook.  He's such a nice son-in-law.  He would not want me to tell you this, but he is a great cook.<br /><br />Maseca Corn Flour is made from ground, dried corn. It can be used to make masa harina (dough) for "tortillas, sopes and empanadas, enchiladas, pupusas, guaraches, arepas and atole," the manufacturer says. It is gluten free.<br /><br />The manufacturer (the Gruma) company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years.

### Don't waste your money or your Keurig on this!
This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty "sludge" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a "cookie cutter" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.

### Not good, couldn't finish my cup
I purchased these at walmart but they were so bad I wanted to come review them so you guys online can be warned.  I brewed myself a cup and it was so bad I couldn't even drink it, i had to throw it out.  First off, I want to say that I'm not a cappuccino snob, I enjoy a great cappuccino at a coffee shop but I also regularly drink the powdered flavored kind that you just mix with water.  I didn't have the highest of standards for this drink to begun with but it was bad, t doesn't have very much flavor the flavor that it does have is not good, it's watery (I brewed it on the small cup setting) and it has a bad aftertaste that I just couldn't get over.  These are also pretty expensive for what you get and you are much better off in my opinion to just go to get a mix with water types.

### Just keep them air-tight
The "frustration-free" packaging is a win.  The cupless cups come 12 to an airtight-sealed package, so it's just a matter of finding an airtight container for them as you go through them.  I appreciate that they're much less waste.<br /><br />This flavor is a good dark roast, which I drink black or with spiced rum.  Some people may prefer a lighter roast, but the coffee itself is quite good.

### Dog loves them
We purchased these for our poodle.  She is the smaller breed (appx. 10 pounds) so I was a little worried these might be too big.  As a whole piece, the treats might be a little large for her, but they can be broken in two very easily.  The bag actually shows you how to break them in two, of course it's pretty self-explanatory as each treat has a cut down the middle of them.  So, the actual size of the treat should not be an issue for those with large or small dogs!  As far as taste--of course I can only rely on how well our dog likes them-she loves them.  Of course she is a little piggy and likes everything, but she really seems to be more fond of these than cheaper treats we have given her.  Overall I am pleased with these treats and I would recommend them if asked!

I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.

### Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED
I don't know if this particular one is recalled though. But I just thought I'd try to give everyone a heads up though.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free. no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free food made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named "Taste Of The Wild" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for "SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION"<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these "better than store" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the "better" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying

### Amazingly Good!
I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic.

We used to raise Montmorency cherries, and these dried cherries are the real deal. As dried fruit, they're perfect: moist, chewy, and wonderfully flavorful. They make a wonderfully energizing snack at the office. Though I generally don't like added sugar on dried fruits, it's really necessary to counteract the cherries' naturally tart taste. Reconstituted, I'm guessing they'd be perfect for tart cherry pies. Certainly the flavor is everything I remember in a really good tart cherry pie, which is almost impossible to find these days.

### Don't waste your money...
If you like rice, quinoa or garlic then don't buy this product. I love quinoa and quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course.The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. In the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this.

### Very Satisfying Granola
The Ultra-Protein Granola Power Crunch has a definitely peanut butter flavour so consider that when purchasing. I actually prefer this peanut butter flavour to their Homestyle Peanut Buttter Granola as I find that one a little flat tasting and the granola isn't as crunchy. The Ultra-Protein one is very crunchy and has quite a few big chunks that are good for snacking and then the crumbles are good as cereal. I don't know if it's the extra protein but definitely feel satisfied with a serving of this with a half cup of yogurt.<br />I've never considered granola cheap or low calorie so in case you're interested each bag has 8 servings and each 1/2 cup serving is 190 cal (70 from fat) and runs around $4.50 a bag. If Subscribe and Save is available I highly recommend doing that since you can save a few bucks and cancel any time.

### One of the worst things I ever tasted
I thought this would taste like the original Bazooka... boy was I wrong. The gum has a weird flavor, something like sweetened gasoline. Gum has a 9/12/13 expiration date so I expected it to be soft and easy to chew, but it was the opposite. Gum was hard and loss its sweetness after a couple of chews. It also left an aftertaste that I couldn't get rid of even after brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. Last but not least, though its sugar-free it is not low calorie; each piece of gum is 20 calories. I have no idea what I'm going to do with this... most likely will toss the entire lot in the garbage. What a disappointment and waste of money.

### Unique product
Being an almond farmer myself, I am always interested to see what new flavors come out. Emerald is a subsidiary of Diamond Walnuts. The description indicates that this flavor is a substitute for the  chocolate covered nuts you may have already had.<br /><br />These merely have cocoa baked onto them. It does give the nut a nice earthy flavor. They have been roasted to the proper crunchiness. But these are not very sweet. If you are looking for them to be a dessert type snack you will be disappointed. The flavor is slightly more savory. The cocoa does not come off in your hand as much as you might expect... a good thing. These would be a nice classy addition to a party/gathering.

### Gevalia Espresso T- Disc  Rivals Starbucks
This is fabulous!  I use the espresso and the foaming milk pods together and of course add a generous amount of Hershey's syrup and stir.  It seriously rivals Starbucks and since my husband gave the Tassimo to me last year for Christmas, I have quit going to Starbucks!  Gevalia is rich bodied, not bitter and if you like Starbucks, you'll love this as well.  In a blind test, I dare you to taste the difference between the two!

### Deliciously Crunchy--to the Bottom of the Bowl
I was very impressed with this cereal.  It straddles the line between the healthy and the sweet/sugary.  The result is a phenomenal cereal that both the adults and children in our house were excited to eat.  In fact, my youngest even opted for this over his usual sugar-saturated brand.  Once we were through with the box, he (and I) were actively looking for this item every time we visited the grocery store.  For me, the crowning virtue of this cereal is that it remains crunchy in a bowl of milk.  Whenever I eat cereal, I tend to eat quickly to avoid sogginess.  One morning, I poured my cereal and had to focus on helping the kids with something and only came back to it after several minutes. With most cereals, I would return to a soggy mess that I poured down the drain.  Amazingly, this cereal was still crunchy and delicious.  That--and its exceptional taste--will ensure that I continue to seek out this excellent cereal.

### My dogs go crazy for these
Heaven forbid that I should run out of these, so I usually order more than one box at the time. My dogs are small, so I always buy the LITE Teenie Greenies. My dogs love these so much they will do anything I ask them to do just to get one. They will come to me when I call them, no matter where they are, if they think they'll get a greenie reward. I give each one of my two little dogs a greenie everynight before their bedtime, and they know the routine so well till one of them runs to her bed and actually opens up her kennel door with her paws, then climbs in and waits for her greenie. I have never seen a dog yet who did not love greenies.  Even my almost toothless fourteen year old schnauzer loves her some greenies.

### Great for larger portions
These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass-produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.

### Not very sweet and expensive.
It doesn't taste bad but i had to measure out the same amount of this as i used to measure out sugar in my coffee. I'm trying to cut down on sugar and i put a lot of sugar in my coffee. 3 heaping tablespoons to be exact and that's if i'm trying to use less sugar. So i basically have to put that much truvia in my coffee. It tastes good but i'll stick with my Ideal. It is very sweet, tastes better then truvia, and It's also cheap. Also i'm not scared of chemicals tested on lab rats that caused problems in extremely high doses. I've eaten McDonalds for Christ sake!!! If i didn't die from that i doubt sucrolose is gonna kill me! =)

### Simple and Easy Baby Food
After having been turned off to canned baby food I was extremely excited to find this product.  I received it for Christmas as my baby turned 4 months old and it works wonderful.  It is so simple to understand and works too well to find an excuse to drop money on canned baby food.  One apple and pear diced and steamed made enough food for 4 days and when combined with a wonderful storage container there is no reason not to cook your own baby food.  I would recommend this product to everyone I meet that has just had a new baby.

### Didn't like it, Wrong one
I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

### Usually excellent product; POOR quality this order
We have ordered cases of the Sea Salt/Olive Oil chips and they have been well liked.  A good balance of crisp, salt, oil flavor and appearance of pale yellow potato like chips. This case of chips was completely un like previous product.  The chips were greasy to feel, oily in appearance, so oily they were transparent and looked like oiled sponges.  I don't know if this was just a bad batch, poor qualilty control or a change from a good product to not good at all.  I will hesitate before re-ordering the chips again.  Such a shame, when most people at least did not feel quite so bac eating what seemed a more healthy chip.  Now they look so saturated with oil that no one would eat them.

### Pistachio Paste Great Flavor
I bought Love n Bake Pistachio Paste for the first time last year at truffle making time and was delighted with the flavor. I've been making home made chocolate truffles from scratch for over 20 years, normally (in recent years) using Love n Bake Praline (hazelnut) Paste and decided to try pistachio on a batch. It was/is delicious. Someone's review mentioned the oil on top when the can is first opened, but that's the nature of the product. Both praline and pistachio MUST be stirred which is no easy chore since both are so thick. Worth the effort, though...for the quality of the product and the great flavoring. Plus you get a little upper body workout to counter the calories of the goodies you're creating! >&lt;>

### Good taste, but light Jalapeno flavor, not spicy
We had tacos tonight and I tried out a couple new sauces from Taco Bell.  One of the sauces was the Bold & Creamy Jalapeno sauce.  I liked the sauce on the tacos, but would have liked it better if it were hotter with a stronger Jalapeno taste.  I like really hot and spicy food, so I found this pretty mild.  With that said, it had a good flavor and I liked it.<br /><br />I could see it being used on a variety of foods the same way you would use a ranch dressing.  The main ingredient is soybean oil and 100 of the 110 calories in a 2 Tbsp serving size are from fat, so this is not a diet or light dressing.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked the taste, but would have liked it to have been hotter with more of a Jalapeno kick.  It is fattening, so don't load up on it.  For a light Jalapeno taste on top of your tacos or other dishes, it is a good sauce.
