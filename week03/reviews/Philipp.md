I have been waiting and waiting for a product like this! The only reason I drink water all day is to avoid the nasty ingredients in diet sodas. Finally, I have a choice that actually tastes great and is good for me. Thank you Zevia!

### Not what you think--taste wise
I tried this and was disappointed. No coffee taste and artificial milk and sweetners. It does not really taste like a cup of cappuchino that you get in a store or restaurant---It is really an artificial made up blend ----stay away or try it at your own risk.

### The Only food for my French Bulldog
My 3 year old French Bulldog was raised on the Puppy version and now the adult. The shape of the food means he has to slow down when eating and cant just swallow it whole. It keeps his gas under control as well (notorious for bulldogs). He's at a healthy weight, skin and coat look great and always get compliments from the Vet on his overall condition. It's more expensive then the grocery store food, but Bulldogs have certain needs that can be properly met with traditional dog food. If you have a bulldog (any variety) This is the food you should be feeding them.

### Thank God I found this food!
We have 2 cats, one of which started having stomach issues about a month after she traveled eight hours and moved into our house. We thought it might be the stress of the drive, the change to a new habitat and a new cat friend. She was throwing up frequently and also having issues on the other end - I won't get into the gross details. A trip to the vet got her some antibiotics that helped for a short time, but she was back to being miserable, and obviously uncomfortable with using her litter box, not two weeks after seeing the vet. Since we found this food and transitioned her on to it, she hasn't thrown up. Her other issues have cleared up too and she is feeling healthy and happy again. So I'll say it again: thank goodness for this food!!!

### Coffee Drinker's Pleasure
While I don't completely understand the "biodynamic" part of the coffee, what I do know is that it presses into an exquisite espresso. The flavor is rich and complex while staying smooth and not overly bitter. My husband likes a nice Americano with enough water to nearly negate the beverage being coffee. Cafe Altura holds its flavor even under such adverse conditions. The only down side is that my body has usually had enough coffee long before I want to quit drinking it. Having it show up on my doorstep when I'm down to the half cup of beans is so perfect. Subscribe and Save rocks.

### Cinnamon Crumble Yum!
I never thought I'd find an organic, vegan, gluten free coffee cake that actually had flavor and personality, but this one has it all! This is the best coffee cake I have ever tasted, GF or not! It can get dry if made a according to the recipe on the bag. All I did was add a little bit of cinnamon applesauce. This increased the moisture. But this never lasts long at out house anyway. Even the 'normal' eaters love it and can't tell the difference. Since we have no nut allergies, I also add pecans on top for a little extra crunch and flavor. This beats any bakery coffee cake in town. This is a great thing to bring to family events, book clubs, bake sales, etc. The price on amazon is the lowest I have found anywhere. Highly recommend!

I tried this tea for the first time at a restaurant - 1st time iced - cool & refreshing, 2nd time hot - mmmm. The taste leans more to the ginger side and not the lemon. I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite. This tea is great for upset tummy.

This IS something, because he is not easily impressed nor surprised and he was both! "It's GOLD!!" Having done a stint bartending and having an obnoxiously acute sense of taste and smell (all that Italian blood running through him I guess), I trusted his reaction. It confirmed my own that these mixes were lightning in a bottle, literally!!! At first, I was reluctant to the buying 3 at a time! All reservations were quickly removed. There is never enough...running out is painful...Worth every dime! The Italian and I couldn't recommend these mixes more passionately!

### I love it!
Generally, I need some sort of sweetener when I drink tea.  With this, there is no bitterness and the flavor isn't overwhelming.  I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed drinking it without any artificial sweetener, sugar or honey.  I can't quite put my finger on the flavor but it has a mild flavor with an aroma that almost seems to clear the sinuses like menthol but it doesn't taste or smell like menthol. The pack is resealable which is a plus.  The only thing I would say is that it is the size of coarsely ground coffee so it didn't work well in my Sun's double wall tea glass as the holes are big enough to allow the grounds through.  However, the "grounds" are not gritty like coffee grounds, so if I drank any, I didn't even notice. I am using a "screen" type strainer now though.

### Best Stevia I've Tried
I've tried several brands of stevia -- I found them funny tasting.  I persisted in trying different types because of the lure of an all natural, no-calorie sweetener.  The artificial sweeteners don't agree with me.  And I never liked the idea of putting them in my body.  Nu Naturals Liquid Stevia is MUCH better than any stevia I tried before.  I use it in cold and hot foods/beverages, as the lone sweetener or sometimes with a natural sweetener like maple syrup or honey (to reduce calories).  Because I like it so much, I haven't bothered to try Nu Naturals Stevia Powder, so I can't offer a comparison.  I highly recommend this stevia product!

Usually put it on after taking a shower and/or shaving.  I will keep using this product until I can't use it anymore or I have to find something better.  This small container goes along way.

### Fans of chocolate cereals will enjoy
Though I've never been a fan of chocolaty cereals, I am a definite chocolate lover. Let's face it, chocolate cereal just never compares to a true gourmet chocolate. I get my chocolate cravings satiated with Carbury or Godiva, not Kellogg's. But if you are a fan of chocolaty cereals then you will probably enjoy Kellogg's Krave.<br /><br />The flavor is very much the same as those other chocolate flavored cereals out there, though the chocolate goo in the middle of this cereal does add a little more richness, that's about it. My kids have loved snacking on this cereal and I agree with other reviewers in that it might make a better snack than cereal since it can get pretty mushy after just a minute or two.<br /><br />All things considered, this probably isn't a cereal I'll buy regularly, but I'd probably pick it up when there is a good sale or something as it makes a fun treat for my kids.

I have been drinking the Green Mountain Colombian for several years, love the smooth, yet full bodied flavor. These San Fransisco Coffee Company pods were bitter and strong tasting and left me with an acidic stomach condition which I hadn't experienced in years.

### If you doctor it up it's okay...
As people have pointed out, this is really more soup than it is chili. I've always considered Chili to be more like stew. Essentially, thick. This is very much watery. You can compensate for this by adding a bit of corn starch before you heat it up however. But... at the end of the day, you should not have to doctor up ready-to-eat soup to make it more like you like. Flavorwise, it has a rather strong chili flavor. To me, this is a good thing. I love chili. However, if you're not too much into it, this will be a bad product for you. This soup is nice if you want a fiber boost, but it's not really as satisfying as real chili.

When you were a kid, did you ever eat saltines with a little jelly? That's exactly what these bars are like. These bars are a pleasant departure from the usual granola bar grabbed on the way out the door to work. These aren't soft like some granola bars and they are break-a-tooth hard like some others. They are super thin, super crunchy, and really, really good. I know these are marketed as cookies, and they are one (minus the sweetness), but really are more like a granola bar. The bars are also low cal (100 calories each) and kept hunger at bay until lunch time. I would definitely buy these and would be delighted to try other flavors - any strawberry out there?

I would like to say that this flavor was many times better in my opinion than the Black Cherry Flavor (or should I say lack of).<br /><br />The Watermelon/Strawberry smell is the first thing that you notice, and it is not a faint smell either.<br /><br />Next, the Watermelon and Strawberry are easily the main flavors in this drink.  It is almost like drinking a liquid Jolly Rancher candy.  As I said about the Black Cherry version, the cherry flavor was way down on the list of included flavors and was very faint.<br /><br />Would I drink this again in the future?

I am in love with these chocolate chips.  Hands down the best chocolate chip on the market.  I eat them out of bag, in oatmeal chocolate ships, as a dipping chocolate, in brownies...  The list goes on and on.  They are not too sweet, are creamy and smooth, and have an AMAZING chocolate taste.  I used to buy them from the grocery store, but they recently stopped carrying them.  I am so thankful that Amazon carries them so I won't have to go through withdrawals.  ;)<br /><br />Oh, and they arrive in PERFECT condition.  Ghirardelli obviously knows chocolate.  I ordered 5 bags and they came expertly packaged in a lined box, with frozen gel packs.  The packs were still frozen and the chocolate was cool.  Absolutely amazing.  I stood there in awe for a minute before calling my boyfriend over to check out the packaging.  We are both very impressed and will reuse the gel packs to keep our food cool when we hike.

### Excellent Source of Magnesium
If you're taking a lot of calcium, you'll need additional magnesium. This Natural Calm powder is a very good source of that magnesium. My wife is taking calcium and was suffering from severe feet and leg cramps (especially at night). A little research pointed to magnesium to help with this. As with calcium, the citrate form is best for absorption and that's what this Natural Calm provides (magnesium citrate). After just a couple of days of use, the cramping seems to have disappeared. One additional benefit is that certain digestive end processes seem to have smoothed out, too.<br /><br />I've also tried a flavored version of this product (Natural Vitality - Natural Calm Rasp-Lemon, oz powder, 16 powder).  Unlike that version, this stuff is entirely odorless, and the only taste is a sense of tartness.  I much prefer this non-flavored version over the flavored version.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this product is that it would have been very nice if the bottle had included a little plastic teaspoon scoop for measuring the dosage.  That's pretty insignificant.  So, I still rate it at an Excellent five stars out of five.  Highly recommended.  Especially if you're taking calcium.

The dogs loved them, but then I learned they were made in China. After the horrible events of last year there's no way I'll feed my dogs products that are made in China. I'd love to find an equivalent treat made in the U.S.

### Good and Good for You
Our daughter needs a gluten-free diet. We've "taste tested" lots of things. Lucky for us she isn't a picky eater, but she DOES know what she likes. And she LOVES these cookies. Great for lunches, great for snack! And we have the peace of mind that it's healthier than other (sugar laden) alternatives.

### Love the product but cancelling my subscription -Amazon raised the $$
I absolutely love this stuff! I don't drink coffee but used to be addicted to the energy drinks... a few years ago a friend suggested that I try crystal light instead - have been hooked ever since. It doesn't give you the jitters, doesn't give you a crash after and you get a whole bottle of water with every serving!  When I signed up for auto shippment in Oct 2010 (6 boxes every 2 months) it was an OK deal ($18 w/ free shipping). Then I got real excited when the price kept dropping. The last two shipments they only charged me $10!!!! Stoked!! But I just got my email saying my next shipment will arrive soon - BUT they are now charging over $20 ?!?!?!?! Ummm doubling the price basically over night with no warning??! No thanks :( I have cancelled my subscription and will now just get it from Target like I used too... Bummer...

### Simply the best box cookies...
These are the same cookies you can get at some costcos across the country, but not at mine, so I was very happy to find an alternative source.<br />However, true to so many of amazons items, the picture does not match the product.  I looked at the picture and saw that it was the same 3 batch box that I usually get, however the description is for a two batches only, so its really NOT a good deal at all.  It's waay more expensive than what is sold at Costco.<br />I knew amazon had a hard time getting pictures to match the actual product sold, so I'm not surprised, just disappointed that I wasn't more careful.

### really is like drinking a chocolate candy bar
I ordered this because it got voted on yahoo top 5, It is chocolate but I guess I like a cocoa flavor better, too rich for me, It really was like drinking a chocolate candy bar. so it is 4 stars if that's what you want,  just not my taste. plus I didn't realize you had to add milk not water to mix. So I still will keep some of the cheap stuff around in case I don't have milk in the house, I'm sure my great nieces will Luv this since they are 8 & 9 yrs old.

### Great but....
Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.

### Lemon & Ginger Tea helps arthritis
I was told in a natural cures for health issues & it told me that Ginger to helps to calm the pain of arthritis. Tryed other products but was unable to get just Ginger Tea. We looked at all the stores near us in Utah but could not find just Ginger tea, we were able to find this brand of tea down in Southern California while on vacation. My husband & I both drink this tea. I have also shared this information with 2 other people that I work with that suffer from arthritis pain. We are all agree that this is the best thing for us.

### When the going gets tough, the Tough Drink Tea
I, too, had a lot of difficulty finding this tea and was glad to see it on Amazon.  I was introduced to this tea in the 1980's by a friend who recommended adding a little maple syrup to it.  That got me started, but I no longer add syrup. The balance and blend of this tea is just too perfect to distort.  For my taste it is superior to any of the flavored or plain black teas I have tried.

Tried various Decaf Brands of Ground Coffee, or Instant coffee, or K-Cups, etc. over the years, but this Jazzed Up Decaf by Emeril tastes so good! You can't tell it's Decaf in my opinion. I'm now able to cut some of my caffeine consumption without "suffering". Thanks Emeril and to discovering it on Amazon.

### My cat loves Spot's Stew, and I know it's good for him.
I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's.

### PG Tips - The tea you've been searching for.
Recently, a good friend offered me some tea she discovered while on assignment in London - PG Tips. A funny name, but a fabulous tea. Coming from an old line of tea drinkers, a 'good cup' has always been our go-to beverage and PG Tips is smooth, tasty, and full-bodied. This is a black tea that delivers the perfect cup every time.

I buy this tea not to use hot in my Keurig but just by accident made it in my cup for Ice Tea - it is wonderful !  A nice change from soda.  Fill your glass with ice, brew your k cup & pour in then add sweetener if desired.  I usually use one sweetner packet.  Try it & you may like it too !

### disappointing
I don't consider myself a coffee snob and I can't afford to drink Starbucks everyday. For the everyday fix, I know where to get my cheap diner coffee or I make my own at home. I was hoping this instant coffee would be a great way to get a quick cup in when all I had access to was the hot water from the water cooler at work. I ended up dumping the entire first cup. I mixed together the recommended water and powder and was hopeful when I smelled the pepperminty aroma. But the first sip was nothing more than hot water. So I added a little more.  Then a little more.  The water got sweeter (but grainer) and the scent got stronger but coffee did not. When I dumped the contents of my mug, the bottom was covered with the lumpy "latte" mix. If all you need is the smell of coffee and peppermint to perk you up, this will do. But if what you want is an actual cup of coffee, don't bother.

### Do Yourself a Favor...Buy it! You Will LOVE IT!
Thanks to the other fine reviews, I opted to try this cocoa powder. It is delightful. While I really like the idea of fair trade certified, without the superior taste and texture it would mean little. Fortunately, it's not necessary to sacrifice quality when purchasing this 16 ounce bag of cocoa powder. Not only is it organic but it's delicious. The texture is fine/smooth, the fragrance is everything you would expect (maybe a bit more!) and the flavor is superb....all for a price you can't pass up. Unlike other varieties of powdered cocoa, this does NOT seem to have vanilla included which makes it a bit more versatile for some recipes.<br /><br />Excellent product!

### Scrumptious!
I don't actually drink very much tea, but my daughter is a bit of a tea snob, so I got this product for her to try. She says it has a subtle citrus flavor with lemongrass undertones. It has a light, refreshing flavor. She encouraged me to try it. Though it is a green tea, it doesn't have the almost grassy flavor I associate with green tea. Even as a non-tea drinker, I can appreciate it, and would drink it again. My daughter highly recommends this, as do I!

### Cats love it
When my rescued stray, Goldie, unexpectedly presented me with four kittens a few years ago, mealtime soon went from "Meow" to "Yuck."  All the little cats had different taste buds it seems.  The household went through several brands of canned cat food flavors with some untouched plates, some barely there plates, and a couple of clean plates.  The day the cats were introduced to Frskies Savory Shreds with Salmon was a day to celebrate.  All the cats love it!  The only reason it didn't get five stars is because I have sloshed salmon sauce on myself and the floor several times.  It could be a bit thicker maybe.

### Do not leave unattended
This toy billed to keep dogs entertained for hours lasted my dog 20 min.<br /><br />Be very careful with this toy. My boy ended up swallowing a big piece which made him sick and resulted in a very expensive trip to the vet. Fortunately it did not cause a blockage, but I'm not taking the risk.

### Amazing!
I usually add half a pack of taco seasoning for more flavor. It makes great chili too (that I also have used for enchiladas). Tastes awesome in an omelet and great on nachos.<br /><br />I have had many countless people try it and no one could tell it was meatless (and I'm from Texas). It's the best tasting meatless tacos I found yet, and each box is equivalent to a pound of ground beef and barely over $2.
