### Yummy Gingerbread!
I didn't eat a lot of gingerbread as a kid.  When I was growing up, gingerbread wasn't a huge tradition ... to me, gingerbread was nothing more than part of a story about a cookie that came to life and got the whole town running after it.<br /><br />But I did eat gingersnaps.  And I loved them!  And since my childhood, I've tried a few different gingerbreads - some were cookie-ish, some were more cake-y or bread-y than cookie ... but I've only tasted a very few that I would say tasted as good as the sharp, peppery snap of a gingersnap.  That warm, sassy spice of a gingersnap - that's what I like!<br /><br />And that's what I taste with this Gingerbread Matcha from Red Leaf Tea.  It is warm and spicy, but not in a hot spicy kind of way.  More of a warm, exotic spicy taste.  And while I did not taste a lot of "bready" or "cake-y" or "cookie" kind of notes to the Matcha when it is prepared traditionally with water, after preparing it traditionally and taking a few sips, and deciding it needed something more, I added just a splash of milk to it, and that did the trick!  Now I have a gingerbread Matcha latte that is absolutely ah-mazing!  I love it!

### I love this oatmeal
i bought it at my local grocer on a whim. had never heard of it but I like oatmeal and it looked diffrent. I've been buying it ever sence. I like the flavor and the texture (not mush like rolled oats). But my daughter (who is 11) thinks it's the most disgusting thing there is and can't stand the texture she says it's "crunchy". But my boys (who are 2.5 and 4.5 always ask for 2nd's when I make it. So, as with any food item, it's all a matter of taste.<br /><br />I don't mind the extra time it takes to make this. But with a family of 5 no breakfast is fast and this actually is faster for me than eggs & sausage, pancakes or french toast.<br /><br />I like it jus with milk and brown sugar.

### Tasty
These taste great!  And it's true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth.  However, as an energy boost for running, they don't do a thing for me.  In fact, they actually cause a stitch.  So I just eat them whenever I feel I need a sugary 'fix'.

### Excellent Coffee But Somewhat Expensive - Recommended
This Starbucks French Roast K-Cup is indeed a very delicious and bold coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. We typically drink the much more affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, but occasionally like to try other types. There is no doubt that this Starbucks coffee is better tasting but it is a too expensive when drinking 4-5 cups a day.<br /><br />Recommended for the flavor (5 stars) but not at the retail price (3 stars).<br /><br />CFH

### Good value for the cost
I was looking for a economical high quality dry dog food.  I have an aged German Shepherd who has trouble maintaining his weight as well as two other large dogs adopted from the local shelter.  Within a month of feeding this food I noticed changes in all of the dogs.  The older German Shepherd gained weight and energy. After a year on this food his coat is thick and shiny.  His weight<br />is maintained at a healthy level.  The other two dogs also have nice coats and weight.  They eat the dog food dry with a few fresh chicken scraps added occasionally.  Check the label and compare with not only the premium brands but with the common supermarket brands.<br />I found that with very little compromise this dog food compares favorably with higher-priced premium foods.  I also have seen that<br />the high end supermarket brands are creeping up to the one-dollar-a-pound price and their ingredients contain many fillers.<br />This dog food can also be fed in smaller quantities than the supermarket brand.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFKUOY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult  Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>]<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OCQ6DY">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Dogs, Chicken and Rice Formula, 40 Pound Bag</a>

I have a golden retriever puppy who will eat anything...anything put in front of him or anything he finds.  I bought these because I trust the Iams name and because they came in a case, I have enough for awhile.  He loves these.  Every time he goes outside he waits for one and when he comes in he waits for one.  Obviously he likes them and while I am still in the housebreaking training, these work great.  I'll keep buying these until he is no longer a puppy then probably change to the adult biscuits.

### Excellent Tea
I have been a long-time fan of Rishi Tea.  They are a company that has a far superior product to most tea found on the market today.  For years, I have ordered excellent teas, handpicked most of the time, from specific regions where only the best of its kind can be grown.  This White Tea (called Silver Needle here) is the first blush, the very first tiny leaves to come out in the spring and they have exceptionally light and delicate flavor.  The Jasmine flowers mixed in are just in the right proportion.  I am not usually a fan of Jasmine Tea.  Normally the only thing you can taste or smell is the Jasmine overpowering your senses.  This is not the case with this tea.  The mix is masterfully blended to give enough Jasmine without overpowering the delicate taste of newly leafed tea.  I hope AMAZON.COM continues to offer these outstanding products from this special company.  I have never tasted a RISHI Tea that I didn't like.  Silver Needle Jasmine is no exception.  If you are looking for a special tea to enjoy on a cool night, this is the one.

### I had high hopes, am a bit disappointed
Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor.

### Another favorite snack of my dogs
For them, they just like how they taste.  For me, I like the fact that they have the glucosamine added to them, and that they are just very basic food, chicken and sweet potato.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was made in the US.  I'll probably always, now, be somewhat suspicious of any pet foods or snacks that are made in any part in China.  My older dog is very creaky and arthritic, and so far we haven't found anything that helps ease her pain, so I can't attest to the healing properties of the glucosamine/chondroitin in these snacks, but I figure it can't hurt to feed her foods that contain them.

### My dog loves the taste.
I'm not sure exactly what this product is meant to be used for.  I would think it would be great to take on walks for a quick reward.  Just whip it out of your pocket and give your dog a lick.  No where on the product did I see the shelf life or how to store it.  I'm assuming it does not need to be refrigerated.  It looks just like a roll-on deodorant bottle.  It's just liver flavored gravy in a deodorant bottle. It's dispensed when the dog licks the ball.  I got the liver flavor. I don't see this lasting very long.  It's a small bottle.  There is a little "window" at the bottom of the bottle so you can see when it's almost empty.<br /><br />I could see these being used for treats in training.  "Chester" says it's great!

### I love these little things!
I find that something with some flavor quenches my thirst better and motivates me to drink more. So I always carry the sticks of powdered flavoring or the True Lemon packets. These, however, don't have to dissolve, which is a problem with some of the powders, especially if you have ice in the beverage. Some of the Mios taste great, like this one, and some not so great (like the mango) but they're all convenient. I think perhaps I don't like the ones that have too strong a Splenda taste, which I've never liked. The peach tea seems to hide it better. I tend to make mine with a lot less flavoring than recommended and this one lends a nice light flavor. One word of caution: if you like to carry the little bottles in a bag or purse put it in a ziploc. I've had them come open and get that highly colored liquid all over!

### The Best Bar on the Market Hands Down
Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch.<br /><br />What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!)<br /><br />I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic...<br /><br />Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market.<br /><br />I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar.

### Delicious! What a Nice Soup!
I've tried a few of the Imagine organic soups and I've enjoyed two different flavors (tomato and mushroom). Today, I tried something new. I boiled up a mixture of organic baby carrots and celery slices and included a thinly sliced Italian sausage. Added to it were a chicken bouillon cube, some black pepper, four bay leaves, some garlic salt and a sprinkling of dill weed. I boiled the mixture until ready to eat. It tasted quite good in itself. Then I added about 8 pounces of the Imagine creamy Butternut Squash soup to the mixture and heated it up again. Oh my, what a nice soup! This stuff was just terrific! I'm sure you could make up a lot of your own mixtures equally good.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!

### holistic health approach-- high in fat and protein-- ask your vet first if your dog is old, a pup, or overweight
My dogs liked the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it.  (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics.  There are NO yucky "meat by-products"-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about.  Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs).  The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product.  If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal.  I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs. or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too).  These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight?  An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing.  Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite "waist" narrowing in front of the back legs.  Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs.  You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).

One of the best snacks we have had.  The wasabi flavor has a real kick.  Everytime we travel, this product would be included in our snack bag.  We enjoyed it so much that we get regular shipments under the "Subscribe and Save" program.  A must try item...

### One Hitch....
I used the Pomi marinara about a year ago and was very impressed with the flavor.  I usually put together my own sauce but occasionally, it is nice to have something tasty that can be used to pull a meal together quickly.  The drawback with the case of this product was not in the product itself but rather the fact the the entire case has an out date in five months. With just my husband and I at home, it is doubtful that I would use it all that quickly. I guess that is the problem with ordering food on-line--you are unable to inspect the out dates on the box. Five months is fine for a couple boxes but not for a case.

### Taste of Home
If you want a candy bar that melts in you mouth, the Cadbury Crunchie bar is it.  Great product and the best service I've gotten from a company in a while.  I grew up eating these and it was a special treat to get some delivered to my home.  They are unavailable where I live now.  The company went above and beyond in their packaging too and they arrived safe and in the best condition.  Would buy these from this company again.

### Just okay
While my family really enjoyed the country ham, they were not fans of the bacon at all. It had a little bit of hard/rubbery texture, even though it was cooked in the oven. We prefer a thick cut bacon that reminds you more of "meat". This cooked up more like a jerky. The flavor of the bacon wasn't there either, just didn't seem "right".<br />Thought the price was a little high for what you got as well.

### Refreshing and healthy
I love this product. It's so subtle, that at first I didn't recognize any flavor. I think the American palette is so used to sweetener in everything, that it is harder to discern what foods or beverages taste like in their natural state. However, once I sipped slowly, Ito En's delicate and light quality was bliss for my taste-buds.<br /><br />It just feels good to know you aren't ingesting sugar, in any of its unhealthy forms, either through high fructose corn syrup, GMO sugar beets, or even fruit juice sweetened drinks that are high on the glycemic index.<br /><br />This tea is what it says on the label: tea! Yum.<br /><br />I even went ahead and placed a case on a monthly auto-order to save on shipping and price. My only regret is that I can only buy enough to have a bottle every-other day. I may go through withdrawal symptoms on those days when I can't drink my Ito En!!!!

I've tried all the vegetarian Taste of Thai boxed noodle products and all the vegetarian Annie Chun noodle bowls. This is by far the best and one of the few in which the sauce combines with the noodles to create a unique flavor. It's deeply savory (umami) and unlike most anything I've tasted as a vegetarian. I could eat these every day.

Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling.

### Best Baby Shower Gift ever!
I didn't purchase this off of Amazon, but I felt the need to review it.  I registered for this and recieved it for my Baby Shower.  It is one of the best gifts that I received.  It's quick and so easy to use.  I make my son's food every three days.  An example of how much can be made at one time is about 8 1/2 oz's of carrots at at time, I dice the carrots, not too small, and add the water, and wait about 15 minutes, and it's steamed!  Then I simply blend it in it's own juices.  Its so great.  I don't freeze his food, he has fresh food every day. Like I said, I make enough for 3 days, etc etc...<br />Trust me, you will not regret getting this product.

### SEEMS TO CONTAIN SOY?
I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

### Fragrant and delicious
This tea takes me back in time to some cinnamon tea I bought a couple of decades ago and never saw again. The fragrance is perfect to cozy up the house on a winter day. With a little touch of honey to bring out the flavors, this tea is just delicious. If you're a coffee drinker rather than a tea person, the robust flavor of this tea is just as rich and fortifying as a good cuppa joe. I also tried it with some orange juice in it, also good.

### Meh.
From the product description: "A brand new taste"- relative to an earlier version? To me it tasted an awful lot like sugar-free grapefruit juice. "Toughest can on the shelf"? I disproved that immediately, while trying to remove the bubble wrap form the single can Vine offered, the knife went a millimeter too deep and made a nice scratch in the can, which immediately burst. I slapped into a containment glass, but it is the Vine's way of rarely offering enough of a food or beverage for the reviewer to form an honest and well considered opinion.<br /><br />OK, ok, I know that's not what they meant by "toughest drink", but I was unaware that was a quality anyone would ever seek in an energy drink.<br /><br />As it stands, I am not very well acquainted with this style of beverage anyway, while I saw them mainly as hangover cures, I guess many regular users see them as an important part of their intake of vitamins and minerals. And Taurine and the other raft of fairly obscure supplements. And often caffeine, although my label was somewhat damaged and I couldn't quite make out the rather extensive list of ingredients. I suspect this is of little interest to the average user in any case.<br /><br />I happened to be pretty beat the day it arrived, and didn't even want to stop for a Five Hour Energy- my usually dependable source of a brief respite from fatigue- so it was a perfect time to try it out. Any "lift" or burst of energy was not readily apparent, although it did help chase away the blahs for a little while. I still went to bed early.

### Nice Pancakes, But Not As Simple As "Just Add Water" Mix.
This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.<br /><br />Edited for grammar's sake.

### Issue with Amazon and Price
This is a great product; tastes great, much healthier than regular commercial peanut butter.  Unfortunately, it is also available everywhere else on the internet for $3.99 while it's nearly $12 on Amazon.  I notified Amazon of this 300% difference in price nearly two months ago and they assured me they would look into it.  No adjustment to the price has been made and I would assume at this point, that it won't be.<br /><br />Buy the product but buy it anywhere else.

If you have soy milk every day, as I do, this is the one to have on hand. I have had liquid soy milk from the supermarket but it's much easier to mix this up yourself than carrying the liquid home. And just one canister makes a lot more than you would buy liquid at one time.

### nice subtle flavor
I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

### Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink
Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce<br /><br />In my opinion, as far as taste, less is more with this product.<br />I drink only water or tea during the day so I was looking forward to adding a nutritional drink to my diet.<br />The first time I tried it, I added too much and it tasted like medicine; more like cherry than fruit punch.<br />As far as packaging, I like having this in a bottle instead of packets however the squeeze part in the cap just did not work for me. I was using a mug to drink from and even though I had this totally upside down it managed to go everywhere! I think just a tiny hole would make it easier and less messy to use. I didn't try this with a water bottle so I assume that would be easier to dispense. Also, with water in my mug I could add more water if I added too much of the drink.<br />I didn't feel energized at any time after drinking this product. The added vitamins can only enhance my diet so I like this aspect. The vitamin content is only 40% for the B (3, 5, 6, 12) and 120% for Vitamin C and 10% for Chromium and Zinc. No sugar or sodium!<br />Since I like the liquid form I will probably buy this in a different flavor.

If you love strong coffee with good rich, full flavor, then Jet Fuel is one you should try!  I have also found that I like it a little weaker sometimes.  I brew it on the large mug setting, lift & lower the lever, and brew another large mug.  The second brew comes out brown in the mug like the first.  This method gives me a 20-ounce travel mug of delicious coffee, tamed down just a bit.  :-)  And if you order with "Subscribe and Save," you'll get this coffee at $0.36 per K-Cup!

Brings out the wolf in your dog!!! My dogs went crazy for these! They last forever and they clean their teeth better than any greenie or other dental chew.

Just keep an eye on them if you have more than one dog because if they are not used to having treats like this, they can become territorial! They realaxed after a couple of days and now they take turns. They are smelly!!! First couple of days they ate them outside but once they started turning white I let my dogs bring them in the house and they chew on them all day and night (not continuously) till they go to bed.  Also a great treat if you have a nervous/neurotic dog because this helps them channel their nervous energy.

### Tastes more like chocolate milk
I like coffee, and I am particularly a huge fan of anything mocha-flavored, so I was excited to try this drink.  I expected it to be similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha</a>, which I find to be quite yummy (although high in calories).<br /><br />To me, this cappuccino-flavored drink tasted more like chocolate milk.  Although coffee is the first ingredient listed on the can, I personally found the coffee flavor to be quite subtle, perhaps because I was expecting something stronger from a product labelled "Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink."  So, in that respect, I was somewhat disappointed.  In addition, there is quite a bit of added sugar in this drink:  18 grams, or over 3 teaspoons.  On the plus side, the product is made with low-fat milk, so there are only 1.5 grams of fat and 100 calories, not bad for flavored coffee.<br /><br />Personally, I would rate this drink at 3 1/2 stars, as the flavor wasn't quite to my liking.  But if you really like the taste of chocolate milk and want a bit of caffeine kick to go along with it (there are 81 m.g. of caffeine per serving), then this Cappuccino Coffee Drink may be right for you.
