### Single Serve Pop Chips
It is so convenient receiving these single serve Pop Chips through the mail.  They stay fresh, and there is no waste or overdoing it.  One little bag is a decent portion of these tasty chips, and I've never seen this size in a store.

My rating is based on the condition of the product when I recieved it.  Of the case of 12 cans I had ordered, 4 of them had serious dents.  I sent an email about the packaging but received no response.  I would give the product itself at least a 4 rating.

### Bitter Green Tea
First of all, the picture that Amazon has with this Organic tea is not the right picture. We are LONGTIME fans of the non-organic Stash Green Tea. In fact, we've probably tried more Green Teas than most people can even imagine. The non-organic Stash is the ONLY green tea that our family drinks.<br /><br />Now, about this organic. My mistake. I saw the picture and hit "add to cart" without reading the title. When it arrived, I thought "oh, boy" and quickly filled our tea jar with the bags of one of the six boxes. We eat/drink as much organic as possible, and I thought we were going to discover something new to add to our shopping list.<br /><br />What a disappointment. We've had two pots already and will discard what's left. It's much lighter in color than we're used to, which isn't normally an issue, but it does have the lack of body that comes with most light teas. It's very bitter, also. It tastes very similar to Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, in our opinion -- and that's about as poor a rating as we can give. Tastes very bitter and burnt. The "burnt" flavour stays in your mouth for a long time after drinking.<br /><br />So, we recommend that you try the non-organic Stash Green Tea. You won't find better. We recommend that you pass on their organic version.<br /><br />Please remember that this review is based on having used four teabags from one box. Perhaps, if we were willing to try another box, we'd change our minds . . . don't think it's going to happen . . .

The product is ACTUALLY Royal Canin HF (HIGH FIBER) for constipated cats. HE is for cats with gastrointestinal problems. i.e. almost the opposite.

### Exactly what are they selling?
When I found this on Amazon, I was about to order... then I had to stop short:<br /><br />How can I have any idea what they're offering for $12?<br /><br />I've heard of buying garlic by weight, or by the individual bulb... but "PACKED IN OUR MEDIUM SIZE JAR. ... 6 INCHES TALL"?  What does that mean? I've seen 6" tumblers that hold eight ounces of water... and 6" champagne flutes holding only half that. How much does a 6" jar hold if we don't know its diameter? (Or even if we do, but don't like to do the math.)<br /><br />Particularly when the picture shows their lovely 6" jar only about two-thirds full? Yes, I know the product settles when shipped. That's why everybody else sells dry products by weight.<br /><br />It gets stranger. The page says "NET WEIGHT: 8 OUNCES". It also says "Shipping Weight: 7.2 ounces"!<br />I can only guess that their 6" jar includes an anti-gravity feature.<br /><br />I'll admit this is the first product I've reviewed on Amazon that I haven't actually bought. Maybe I will in the future, if somebody tells me what I'd be paying for. And if they update their page to include a meaningful cost per ounce, I'd be glad to pull this review.

### delicious and makes me feel good to eat it
I always loved to have sugar-free Jell-O as a dessert with my lunch but lately I have become concerned about artificial colors and couldn't bear to eat something that clearly has that much Red 40 in it. I went several weeks without any tasty low-cal desserts when... enter Better Bowls! The strawberry flavor is delicious and it is something you can feel good about eating. The vanilla pudding is excellent as well, particularly with a few mini chocolate chips sprinkled on top.

### A lot of hype
I've been using this conditioner for two weeks and as far as I can tell it is just a lot of hype. It's no better than any other department store conditioner. In fact, I much prefer my regular conditioner Aussie Moist to this. It takes twice as much of this conditioner to get it through my hair and remove tangles that it does my Aussie. Afterwards, my hair feels good, but no better than it does with my regular conditioner. What I especially don't like is that the conditioner is tinted pink. I have light blonde hair and I don't normally use conditioners with dyes because they stain my hair. It has been years since I have even seen a conditioner with dyes in it. I thought that went out of practice in the 80s.<br /><br />Overall, I would not use this again. There are better conditioners on the market and I would prefer something without dyes.

### Healthy Snack - But Watch the Calories
I received the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters in a 11 oz bag.  I'm fairly health conscious and I'm happy to report that these seem to fit the bill as part of a healthy diet.  Each serving contains a generous amount of fiber (5g) and Omega-3s (750mg).  It is also claimed to be gluten free which is becoming more important as people discover their sensitivity to gluten.  Since I'm watching blood pressure, I always look at sodium content and I was happy to see only 20mg per serving.  Sugar is a little high at 5g per serving* which I will explain later.<br /><br />Although this product could be great in yogurt or with milk, I just ate it raw from the bag. The texture was perfect for me.  It was neither too crunchy nor too soft, but just the right amount of chewiness.  The flavor was a little strong for me.  It overwhelmingly tasted of vanilla extract.  I prefer a lighter more subtle flavor, but that is subjective.<br /><br />Aside from the flavor, there are a few other cautions. The serving size is only 1/3 cup.  This is unrealistically small.  Few people will only consume that amount unless  sprinkling it on yogurt or grabbing a handful for a quick snack.  If eating it like cereal or a significant snack, 2/3 to 1 cup is more realistic.  As with all granola type snacks, the calories then become an issue.  At 120 calories per small serving, a 1 cup consumption (3 servings) would amount to 360 calories.  Sugar would rise to 15 grams.  My average snack amount was about 2/3 cup or 240 calories which is still pretty high.  At that level, I also suffered from a little gastrointestinal distress - probably from the flax seed which my body wasn't used to.<br /><br />Overall, I give this a 4 out of 5 star rating.  It is a healthy food with relatively low levels of sodium and high levels of fiber.  Those who are weight conscious need to watch the serving sizes as the calories can really add up.  But I give this product a positive recommendation as a tasty and healthy food.

### Good Quality Food at a Reasonable Price
My puppies were on Nutri Source which is also a nice food but I wanted something I could get more easily. The first pup I transitioned over to Iams but he tired of it quickly. The positive reviews on Wellness prompted me to try it and I'm very glad I did. He gobbled it down, first bowl. The second pup had a bout of diarrhea, even with me mixing the old and new food together to get her used to it. I'm not sure if the food was the cause as my other dog also had the runs at the same time, but they're doing well now and enjoying their Wellness diet. I love that Amazon has this on prime delivery. I've also switched my cat over to Wellness but he never tells me anything so I'll assume it's acceptable for him.  :)

### Why mess with success?
My 20-month-old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.<br /><br />However,<br />1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like.

### It's OK but check the ingredients label
I thought this was pretty decent. I found the scent pleasing without being over-powering and the scent did not linger in an obnoxious way. The body wash lathered nicely and when rinsed off, did not leave my skin as dry, flaky and scratchy as some other products I've used in the past.<br /><br />What is disappointing is that this product contains Petrolatum which is a by-product of petroleum (also known as petroleum jelly.) Petrolatum has been linked to causing or inflaming acne, it can actually clog your pores and of most concern is that it has been recognized as being a possible cancer risk. A bit of Googling will reveal all of this and more.<br /><br />Bottom line for me is that there are plenty of other skin care products that do not contain Petrolatum. I would not buy this again.

The box says the flavor has been "improved" which is a shocking claim in light of the absolutely digusting flavor and appearance of this pasta. Besides rice flour, it also contains rice bran, which I guess is supposed to give it a texture closer to wheat pasta. Well, it doesn't work, and it also gives the pasta a disturbing beige hue and a truly vomitous taste. My two year old and I spit it out almost simultaneously.

### The same as any other dark roast k-cup
I drink a lot of k-cups due to the fact that my work has the machines and provides a great assortment of flavors. I would compare the Kona k-cups to just about any other k-cup that's medium or dark roast. It's a decent flavor, but a huge disappointment because I was overly optimistic that it would taste closer to real kona that is fresh brewed a more traditional way.<br /><br />If you aren't expecting too much, this is a decent cup of coffee.

If your only experience with kona is this stuff, you're missing out on a great cup of coffee at a decent price.

### Great snack....even during battle!!
I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training)...which is where you learn warfighting techniques. For those LONG, sweaty, depressingly hot days in NC...this was an excellent snack. Beef Jerky is nutritious, low in fat content and tastes great! It also is a great chewy snack for those 'hurry-up-and-wait' days. Perhaps the biggest benefit for me was the salt....if you're out in the sun all day, you lose a lot of sweat....the Marine Corps motto should be 'drink water'...but as for electrolytes/ salt....this snack does an excellent job. I love the peppered taste...probably because I'm Jamaican. The 1.5-ounce snack size fits perfectly in your pocket and works out to be about half the price you'd pay at the gas station (thanks Amazon). I have a couple of buddies over in Afghanistan and I sent each two packs....for them and to pass around to their troops...they love it.<br />For a healthy snack (especially if you're very active and sweat a lot)this is a great product.<br />If there was one complaint....I wish the desiccant that is inside every bag was somehow shaped differently.....if you grab a handful in the bottom...you'll never know that you grabbed the desiccant too....luckily I've been able to catch it!

### Great Product
Great product, but I ordered in August and shipping took a few days.  I didn't feel so great receiving a very warm can of fish.  I immediately opened it and placed it in the fridge.  At first it was a little soupy but is firmed up and the contents were fine.  Actually, peeling the filets off is pretty simple just do it under running water and start from the head end and peel off one filet at a time - takes about 10 seconds per fish.  As others have said, they are not as salty as oil packed because you really need to rinse them off.  Also, soaking these fish first is completely unnecessary.  Just run them under water while you peel and they are perfectly fine and not salty once they are boneless - soaking in milk or water for twenty to thirty minutes does nothing but waste time.

### Professional Driver On A Closed Course! :-)
Like most of the reviews posted here, I give this product a positive rating. For me, it does what it claims to do... and I especially appreciate the "no crash" effect after a few hours! I first found out about this product when I started racing Go-Karts this year... I hit the local Stop-N-Shop before getting to the track and decided to plunk out the $3.00, as I was a bit tired. I threw it in my cooler and then drank it just prior to my qualifying session. Almost immediately, I could feel the "boost"... and it helped out on track! I never felt the Niacin rush that some claim, but the one thing I did notice, was that my jaw was a bit tight due to the jolt of energy. I only have few suggestions: I've tried all the flavors, and I think the Orange flavor is the best; I drink the product chilled... tastes better to me that way; the flavor is a bit too sweet for me so I add it into my personal water bottle; I buy this on amazon because it's a lot cheaper than buying it at my local Stop-N-Shop!

### Great value, great for your health
I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

These normally go for $3.49/per bag in the supermarket/grocery store and usually are not 1 of the type of Pepperidge Farm Cookie that goes on sale at all, unlike their Milano Cookie Brand counterpart which do on a semi-regular basis. A great deal, highly recommended, buy them if the price is right!

### Great Product!!!
I agree wholeheartedly with some of the recent reviews below.  My son has a dairy intolerance and I had to stop breastfeeding when he was 4.5 months old.  This product was a lifesaver!!  He drinks it happily, and his symptoms, since switching to Alimentum, have subsided (knock on wood).<br /><br />That said, beware of ordering through Amazon. I ordered several cases for my baby through Amazon Prime almost one month ago & have received multiple emails telling me that the product is unavailable for shipment. Meanwhile, several vendors list the product as available on Amazon (including Amazon's subsidiary, Diapers.com). I've contacted customer service several times, but have continued to get the runaround.  I suspect that this has to do with an attempt to avoid honoring the lower list price (the Amazon prices drastically increased recently).  It's a sad sad day when Amazon disappoints.  Notably, when I've ordered the full price product through Diapers.com, it's arrived the next day.<br /><br />In any event, the formula itself has been great!

### Great product!
Helps me sleep through the night.  And several friends who I've recommended Calm to, they've tried it and love it.  Helps de-stress which so many people need nowadays.  It's also especially good for those who have had lots of calcium in their life and their body may not have absorbed it well.  Great for those who have calcified joints - - decalcifies.  So many benefits.

### two types of Feline Pine
Feline Pine WAS making two types of cat litter, but the BETTER of the two is becoming hard to find.  One con given for what I shall call the 'rabbit food pellet' variety was that is doesn't clump.  I HATE the pellet type of litter, and my cats don't care for it either.  HOWEVER,  Feline Pine DOES (or at least, DID) make a CLUMPING variety of pine litter that works WONDERFULLY.  It's small grain pine granules of sawdust are light, smell great (and continues to smell better even after use - more than ANY other type of litter I've come across) and clumps reasonably well with the addition of guar gum - a food type of thickening agent.  It doesn't clump quite as well as clay litter, but doesn't have any of clay's disadvantages, either.  A good trade off, in my book.  It was first recommended to me by a friend of my daughter's who pet sits for us on occasion, because her allergies made clay litter problematic.  I took some to my mom because the weight of clay litter was a problem for her 84 year old arthritic hands and bad shoulder.  What I don't understand is why anyone would use the pellet kind when the MUCH better clumping Feline Pine is available.  Now it's getting hard to find the clumping kind in local stores, but the pellet fad seems to be taking over.  I don't get it.  The five stars I gave are for the clumping variety - I wouldn't give the pellet kind more than two - it does still smell better than clay litter, but that's pretty much the only thing to recommend it in my book.  I need to find the Feline Pine website and tell this to them too.

### My baby loves these!
My son has been eating these since he was 7.5 months old and had 8 teeth (he is 11 months now). He absolutely loves them! I love that they are organic (obviously) and that they come in packs of 2. I never leave the house without throwing a pack in our backpack - they've saved me from many meltdowns!<br />Could they pose a choking hazard? Yes. But I have never had an issue and he eats at least 3 of these a week. As with any snack, you have to watch your baby like a hawk. Mine has not choked once.

Very pleased with this item. It's very versatile, tastes great by itself and also nice to sprinkle on various foods, one of my favorites is on spaghetti, where it serves as a nice substitute for Parmesan cheese.

### A Touch of Elegance
It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

### One complaint: opening GU gels are problematic in colder temperatures!
I highly value GU as a supplement, its the only gel I use in running and cycling. However, most of the popular fall marathons, such as NYC, Chicago, Philly, and MCM, are scheduled when temperatures are cooler -- sometimes downright cold! Well, I'm running Philly, which in 2011 is scheduled for November 20th. To train for this marathon, I run at night when temperatures drop. One thing I've noticed on long runs is that when the temperature is 40-45 degrees, and I reach for a GU at mile 13 (about the time I usually do), opening the package is labor-intensive, and ripping it with your teeth isn't the answer when breathing through a challenging point in a course. Try opening a GU gel when running up or down a hill in colder temperatures. Even the top tab (or nipple as I call it) is hard to open. My complaint: THE PACKAGE NEEDS TO BE PREFORATED AND MADE EASIER TO OPEN! I'll say it again, GU needs to make the packaging easier to open for runners and cyclists. It has nothing to do with hand strength. It has nothing to do with sweaty hands. The package should be easier to open. Period. Other than that its a 5-star product in my opinion.

I wanted to try a recipe which called for Nutritional Yeast - something I had never heard of before.  I did a little research to find out more about nutritional yeast and I was intrigued. It is very tasty.  I sprinkle it on my fruit breakfast every morning. I have used it in soups, sprinkled on vegetables, on pasta. It adds a unique flavor, which I like very much.  I have to trick my boyfriend into eating well and this is a great way to add Vitamin B12 to any dish.

### Completely inedible
The first bite was horribly rancid, and I rushed to the garbage can to spit it out.  Then I rushed to the bathroom to brush my teeth and get rid of the last foul particles.  Even though this was not a normally refundable item through Amazon, they did give me a full refund, but they were not interested in my offer to ship it back to them at their expense to find out what went so horribly wrong.  The food safety system in this country is horribly broken.  After the peanut scancal of last year, it would be nice if something had changed and people were more responsible for what they put out there.<br />  In my opinion, the problem was improper storage temp. at the ware house, or ingredients too old.<br />Really a shame because it is such a good cause otherwise, and I love nuts.

### Pretty Tasty, but Not as Good as Valdosta
The Sahale Soledad mix is similar to my Sahale fave mix, Valdosta, in that it's a mixture of nuts, dried fruit, and spices, with a varied texture of chewy and crunchy and a mixture of sweet and spicy flavors, but there is something about it that I'm not quite in love with. It's not the stickiness, because I don't mind that except for the it being a bit messy if I'm snacking while on line, which I often am.<br /><br />I guess, as I've said before in my reviews of Sahale nut snacks, I think every one of them pales in comparison to the perfection of the Valdosta variety. In fact, I'm so crazy about the Sahale Valdosta mix that I posted a Haiku in praise. I know, pathetic. So, take my opinions of the other flavors with a grain of sea salt.

### Very tasty
These bars (all of the roll types) are hard to eat. That's actually part of why I like them so much. Because they take some effort to bite into and chew, they basically force you to eat slower. As a result, you feel more satisfied at the end of eating one than if you had scarfed down a candy bar in three bites. I don't find them hard as rocks though, just very chewy. If you don't like chewy food, then these are definitely not for you. I also really like the texture contrast between the crunchy/crispy outside and the chewy nougat inside of the bar.<br /><br />There is a bit of a mess factor involved in eating these, as noted by one reviewer. The caramel is sticky and sometimes leaves traces on the wrapper, and the outside crispy/crunchy coating tends to crumble off a bit. If you want to keep the inside of your car spotlessly clean, you might not want to chow down on a Go-Lean roll bar while driving. Nevertheless, I still think these are some of the best bars out there. They are not discernibly chalky nor do they have a strange chemical aftertaste the way that many protein or energy bars do. They really are like fortified candy bars. And they pack quite a high protein and fiber punch for only 190 calories each, while only having about 13 mg of sugars--about 1 Tablespoon--per bar (I was expecting more like 25-30 mg when I tried my first one). The chocolate turtle roll is my favorite flavor, but honestly, I've tried every single flavor of the Go-Lean Roll bars, and they are really all quite good.

### Possibly the best cereal ever
I was never been a fan of Raisen Bran, and really had no intention of trying the Crunch version.  I was at a friends house, and that was all he had avialable, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  Keeps a crunch, nicely sweetened, and the raisens are a great counterpoint to the flakes.<br /><br />That was about a year ago.  Now RBC is my main breakfast cereal, with very little straying.  I turned my Dad onto it, and he is the same way.  We use the Amazon Subscribe and Save as it makes it about $2.50 a box vs. the $4.00 a box it is in the local grocery.  I have 4 boxes comes in about every 2 months, and have no issues going through it.

### Awesome taste!
I love this stuff! Wild Ride Hoppin' Hickory has NO nitrites and NO MSG. It is made with natural ingredients, which is about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 240 calories, or 60 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat. I'm watching my weight, and Wild Ride is a welcome addition to my balanced diet.<br /><br />Essentially, it is sliced steak in a bag. An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Hoppin' Hickory has a spicy and smoky flavor that is perfectly balanced and not too overpowering. MMmmmm! Yummy!

### Super Duper Yummy Delicious!!
Is it a side dish?  Is it a dessert? Who cares!! This stuff is SO super delicious that in our house, there are never any leftovers. Ever.<br /><br />Mixes up in 2 minutes or less by adding melted butter/margarine, water and a can of creamed corn.  Directions say to bake in a loaf pan, but I've baked one in an 8x8 pan when I needed to make 2 packs at once and it came out just fine with a shortened bake time. (I would only recommend using a non-loaf pan if you have baked more than once or twice and can gauge for yourself when a baked item is done.)<br /><br />Moister and sweeter than corn bread, I like to serve it with a round ice cream scoop!<br /><br />In my grocery store, one package is $$1.99 so this is a sweet deal!

### Excellent!
OK, so this soup is full of fat and sodium, but it's still the best tasting cream of chicken soup anywhere! If fat and sodium is a problem, then just drink less of it. The best tasting cream of chicken is when you add 1/2 full milk and 1/2 water, but that might be a bit too much, so you can use 2% milk instead. The way I make it is to put the soup in the pan and slowly add the milk and water. If you add water/milk right away to the soup you'll get lumpy soup. And there are tons of recipes on the internet, it's just the best tasting soup ever!
