### Just perfect...Filled with natural goodness. Love my breakfast .A++
While in university, I used to visit friends at a farm where they made jam from scratch, baked their breads and hunted for meat. Our friend Gladis was an excellent cook, and had a spread for us on weekends. After I graduated, moved away to a big city, busy life and purchased food off grocery shelves to whatever fell within arms reach...:0) Although the Smucker's jam was not bad, I decided to try the stonewall sold on amazon. I was in for a treat. Just like the good ol days..Tasted fresh, they used cane sugar, no sweetener , and it was filled with berries.Just like how they made it on the farm...

### Great energy bar
These bars are fantastic- I love how they are not overly sweet like every other bar I've tasted ie luna and cliff bars. I LOVE that- all I taste are gently sweet dried fruit and nuts, not sugary crap that gives me a tummy ache. All natural stuff. I think for many people with low ratings of this product regarding taste, that is their beef- "no flavor" when they are used to super sweet processed taste. These bars are great for people with any sort of intolerance for soy or gluten and make great snacks after a workout.

### Tastes burnt
I did not care for this product at all.  I was expecting more of a Demerara sugar taste and this is WAY more intense.  Tried to use it in iced tea - taste burnt.  PLUS - beware - you can't return it.  It is a grocery item on Amazon and they won't accept returns.  I'd find some somewhere to try before buying these big containers.  I used one cup and hated it and then had to just give it away.

My twins dislike most vegetables, but they have happily eaten these green beans since they were six months old.  They're 15 months now, and they still prefer them to almost anything else I put on their trays, including cheese, fruit, and even their own birthday cake. They'll eat other green beans, too, but these are definitely the favorite (and clearly preferred to the ones I make myself).

### Not even close!
I bought this because the title made me think it might taste a little like a chocolate glazed donut. Not even close! Actually, as a cup of coffee, it's not bad. Not too strong, and not at all acidic. Very smooth, and fairly mild. A pretty darn good cup o' joe. But donut? No. Glazed? No. Chocolate? No. Not. Even. Close. The name does not say "cappuccino", but you might think along those lines if you image a cup of coffee flavored like a chocolate glazed donut. But this blend has no cream, no sugar, no chocolate, no glaze, no donut, and as far I can tell, no flavoring what-so-fricking-ever, except... well... coffee.

### Allergies Begone!
So far, this is one of only 3 dog food brands that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food. Our australian shepherd had pink around his mouth and on his belly before switching. It has limited ingredients, less chance of food alergies. I have tried many high cost and probably high quality foods but nothing worked. I ended up having the best luck with this and with Purina one smartblend of all foods. I know, I know, that's not what you read when you research the internet but my dogs do best on Purina or this California brand.

### Economical and Delicious
I've been drinking white teas for years and was thrilled to find the Prince of Peach Organic White Peony teabags on Amazon.  My local store only carries the smaller box of this particular Prince of Peace tea, and since we drink it daily, Amazon will be our go to source from now on.  The tea is not the prized Silver Needle, but for an organic tea in an unbleached bag with little packaging waste that is all compostable, it's a no brainer.  I brew it at a lower temperature, usually filtering the boiled fresh water over an ice cube as its being poured onto the teabag/s.  I highly recommend this white tea!

### not correc size
This product is not the 9 ounce bag as advertised but is actually 8.1 ounces.  Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.

### Very disappointed
I was so looking forward to finally having chocolate covered gummies in the house, as they stopped selling them at our local candy store. When they arrived they were slightly melted to one another but not badly.There was an ICE PAC in the packaging, but it had long lost its coolness. However the gummy bears still held their shape and came apart from each other easily. The sad part was when I ate some.  I found myself chewing endlessly on a gummy that had no desire to break down in my mouth. It was like chewing chocolate covered rubber bands. And the chocolate was not the best I've ever tasted either. So now I have Two lbs of gummy bears I have no interest in consuming. Really sad. :-(<br />The ones I would buy at my local kosher bulk candy shop were amazing and had a wonderful soft texture. Oh well, I guess my search continues. If you like gummy bears that are rubbery to chew, then these are for you, if you like gummy bears that are tender and easy to chew, then look elsewhere!<br /><br />DTS

First, you have to like real, bold coffee (which I do) to like this coffee. If you like this coffee, also try Organic, Black Tiger, and Wake Up Call. Each of these is similar but have slightly different tastes. I like to buy them in boxes of 50 using automatic delivery (can't beat the price that way).<br /><br />The coffee tastes great. I would classify it as bold/extra bold. I gave it 5 stars, and I continue to buy it along with the others that I mentioned.

### Choosy Indians Choose KOI
I didn't think that this Butter Chicken Curry paste would hold up to a traditional, home cooked Indian meal...but I was gratefully wrong. My mom is a fantastic cook and this paste does a great job emulating that authentic, home made taste. At roughly $2 (or less on sale), this is far cheaper than going out to eat at an Indian restaurant.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I make this but we first cook down some sweet onion and brown the chicken a bit before adding the curry paste and water. The instructions tell you to add raw chicken but that sounds a little odd to us. We also like to add some extra heat via red chili powder. If you brown the chicken first, cut it into large enough pieces so that they don't dry out during cooking. We've also used this paste to make butter shrimp & it's a great alternative. All of our friends (Indian + non-Indian) LOVE this stuff. Indian approved!

### If you like your cashews oily, you may love these -.
I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their "no return policy" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome.

### Splinters anyone?
I have a couple of dogs, one of which, loves to chew on bones. I gave it to my dog as a Christmas treat and it went to town. But later I found little splinters on the floor. It did not register to me at first since it had lost the meat flavoring color and it was pure white. Still being oblivious at the time, I tried to give the same dog another one, seeing how he loved the first one, and he just walked the other way. Then after my dog threw up, the bone splinter riddle was solved.<br />Later, my daughter, who works at a dog adoption organization, told me that I should have never given my dog pork bones... at least not the dried out variety. Perhaps this won't be a problem for your dog but my dog can really chew thru bone... so maybe that was it. In any case, lesson learned for me with my dogs. And perhaps a heads up for you and your dog if you have any concerns.

### Great Taste and Energy, Buuuut. . .
I ADORE this drink! It's the next best thing to coffee in the morning (though a lot of people's stomachs probaby handle that . . .But I'm a college student and coffee here is EXPENSIVE!).Heck! It's good for anytime of the day (well . .you may want to avoid drinking it after 6 or so if you want a decent sleep (unless you have to cram for a test or whatever) . .I've only had the original (citrus) kind though . ..I'm kind of curious about the others . . .<br /><br />Anyway, what dissapoints me is the shipping cost . .What the heck!? $20!!??!! That's almost the same amount as the drinks themselves! . . .and here I thought I was getting an uber great deal (it's still cheaper here by a little bit though so I guess I can't complain too much . . .)

### They taste soooo bad!!!!  Gross!!!
I got these for my dad from his wish list.  He thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell.  The box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag, it's impossible to even want to put yourself through that again.  They are nasty!!!  Avoid them at all cost!!  Yuck!!

### Almost wonderful
I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make.  The first lemon flavored Sweet `N Low cake I made was adequate but did not have any fresh tart lemon flavor.  The next time I tried using half lemon juice and half water and something very strange happened to the texture, it felt like a sponge.  Not a sponge cake but a dish sponge.  I keep trying to find the right amount of lemon juice to add and have not hit on it yet.  If you do not mind a mild and slightly artificial lemon flavor, than this is a great product.  For first time users I wish that the product description here specified that these mixes make a single thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.

### Mild smooth taste
This coffee is for people like me who like a light-roasted (therefore presumably high caffeine), mild, smooth coffee. Those who like dark roasts propabably will not like this because a light flavor accompanies a light roast.<br /><br />Related issue for those who are concerned with "Fair Trade": I misread the extensive writeup of this coffee and so I did not notice that the words "Fair Trade" are neither in the description nor on the package. So, if that is the case, then it might be that this coffee is great for reducing the carbon footprint, but might not conform to fair trading standards for the peasant growers.

### OMG.  Why use another soy sauce?
Friend of mine from Hawaii turned me onto this sauce.  I have to say that I never gave soy sauce much thought before except at the occasional sushi restaurant.  But now I cook nearly everything with this stuff.  Whatever seasoning they give it is perfect and gives the soy sauce just the right amount of zing.  Highly recommend.  Never going back to Kikoman or whatever.

### Outstanding Treat for Cats
Our cat is the ultimate of fussiness. She will only sleep on down pillows, and will only drink bottled water from a crystal goblet. Her favorite food is Florida stone crab (at $39 per pound currently). Thus, I thought she would be a tough test for Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna. She loved it! She even begged for more. But to give it a further test, I tried it on my daughter's three cats, and they loved it. From this, I conclude that Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna is likely to be a real treat for cats.

### Good Bone for Strong Chewer
Both of my dogs are heavy chewers (corgi and samoyed). They like having bones to chew on and Nylabone fits the bill. No problem with teeth or cutting, but as I said, my dogs are heavy chewers. This is their go-to bone for chewing. If your dog isn't a heavy chewer I might suggest the flexi chew version.

### Devine....Simply Heavenly!
How HEAVENLY are these? I can honestly say that Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are my VERY favorite candy! I absolutely LOVE these! Maybe it's because they remind me of childhood.  My mother used to always buy me candy once a week at the market and I could pick out whatever I wanted.  Guess what I picked week after week?  Yes! You guessed it, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!<br /><br />These are at a truly discounted price for a box of thirty-six (36) with two pieces in each package. (Just like if you bought them as a single package) Which actually makes a total of Seventy-Two (72) cups. This is definitely enough for the entire family to have for quite a while. And to be quite honest, I was worried at first that maybe they were discounted because they would come stale or smashed during shipping or broken. But, I thought at this price it was enough for me to want to take the chance.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that they were fresh, and delicious.  They came double boxed in the mail and very quickly.  I have dealt with this seller several times and have NEVER, not even ONCE had a problem.<br /><br />If you are thinking of ordering these, or any type of candy from this seller, do not hesitate.  They are always pleasant, prompt and very professional.  A *Perfect* transaction every single time.<br /><br />You can also freeze these, put them in the refrigerator or add them to ice cream.  We love these in a variety of ways.  Enjoy!

These Ghiottini brand almond biscotti are the best-tasting biscotti I have ever tried. Loaded with real almonds, the ingredients are all legible and natural, which seems like a rarity these days. Similarly, I recommend Cantuccini brand "almond cookies," or biscotti. These gourmet Italian imports are the finest and make great gifts.

The shipment came in pretty quickly, the box is blue and branded as pirates booty. Inside there are 12 4oz bags as you would expect. I love these and usually have to stop myself from eating a bag in 1 sitting. At the local grocery store in town these are $2.79 for the 4oz bag. Here I got these for under $24 with the 'subscribe and save' that you can cancel right after. So you can save 30% by ordering here which is great for pirates booty fans like me.

### Great
This is very tasty as a marinade or to cook with.  I've used it on chicke and pork and both turned out wonderful.  It's not overly hot or sweet, but a perfect combination of both.  Some in my family don't like sweet food and enjoyed this.  A good way to use it is in the crock pot over a pork butt.  Make a fruit salsa and you have the makings of a delicious taco.

### I wish this product came in a better bottle
The product seems to work well. My hair held it's shape most of the day. The only problem is the nozzle on the bottle. It's very difficult to use. It seems to require a lot of force to get the product out of the bottle. That's the only issue I really have with this product. Although it's volumizing mousse it still works well with curling irons. I have used volumizing mousse for this in the past. I have fine hair so it's enough for me. I'm not sure how much it protects from the heat but according to the bottle you really have to use a lot of product to get enough protection. You basically have to coat all your hair with the product. I will update again on the product later on when I've used it more. So far I have only used it once. I would likely not buy this again just cause of the nozzle. It's really difficult to use because of the force it takes to use it.<br /><br />Update 4/13/2011<br /><br />I was showing someone how it takes a lot of force to get the mousse to come out and when they tried it I heard a snapping sound and suddenly the mousse was coming out easily. It seems there may be something inside the bottle that has to be released in order for the mousse to come out like normal. I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. It seems I could not use enough force to snap the release but a male friend was able to. I used the mousse with my hot tools deep waver and the waves lasted for 2 and a half days and even withstood me sleeping in them. It probably would have lasted longer but at that point I wanted to wash my hair. If you use a lot of mousse the hair will become stiffer but better protection from the heat and the style lasts longer. I would purchase this again now that I realize what the problem was.

### Smooth Coffee - Recommended
This Donut House "Chocolate Glazed Donut" K-Cup is very smooth and does indeed have a distinct Chocolate Glazed Donut flavor. The aroma while brewing is wonderful but the coffee is not too overpowering.<br /><br />Being a Type 2 diabetic, this is as close to real donut that I can get, so taking it with Splenda and Half&Half is a real treat in the mornings for me. My son (not diabetic) likes it better than other flavored coffee, but he says there is a bit of a chemical after taste that I didn't notice and it hasn't stopped him from making several cups for himself.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

Now I can have my very own Pumpkin Pie Latte anytime I want!

### My Cats Refuse To Eat It
My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment). My cats like other flavors of BFF, they just wolfed down a plate of Tuna Too Cool for dinner, but they do not like this one. I've tried feeding it to them several times and they just don't like it. One of them ate a bit of Tuna & Chicken Chuckles and threw it up and the other just refused to touch it. My cats are really picky, though. I'll donate the rest of the case of this to my local shelter where I'm sure the kitties will find it a glorious treat and get my feline food critics something else.

### Senna Leaf tea
A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular. He was so right. A cu p of Senna Tea with my dinner has been better then metamucel for regularity. It tastes good, and I recommend it to anyone who has constipation problems due to medications. If you eat out, you can take the tea bag with you and ask for a cup of hot water to steep your tea in, and you do not have to worry about missing a dose.
