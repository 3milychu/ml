### I love this coffee, but it is very mild.
I have recently switched to decaf most of the time, and love the convenience of K-cups for making a fresh cup. Only a few K-cup coffees taste as strong as I used to brew a pot (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL4ZY">Tully's Coffee Decaffeinated French Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> (extra bold) is the only decaf variety that can make that claim, and can be brewed in 10 oz. size!) and these Green Mountain flavored varieties are on the weak side. I brew them in 6-oz size to get them as strong as possible, and they aren't bad. I don't like sugar in my coffee and love flavored varieties, and these are very nice and elegant tasting. My husband can't abide flavored coffee so the K-cup machine (ours is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049NVR3S">SS-780SA Single Serve Brewing System</a>) has solved the problem of freshness, decaf vs. caffeine, and flavor vs. unflavored. He prefers <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZE83FA">Tully's French Roast Extra Bold Coffee For Keurig K-Cup Brewing Systems 18 K-cups Count</a>.

### sticking with Zantac
The Vine program sends you a sample of this product that makes one pot of coffee, so perhaps the "low acid" benefits become more apparent with repeat use.  But as Missus 1rude remarked, "I'm sticking with Zantac".<br /><br />The coffee produced by the Puroast grounds somehow managed to be both bitter and flat - for reference, I typically find Starbucks coffees to be bitter and Maxwell House ones to be flat.  If you're a heartburn sufferer and a coffee lover, it might be worth trying the Puroast to see if you find it more palatable than we did.  But it wasn't for us.

### YUCK.
I was so excited to receive my first dutch-processed cocoa powder especially after all the wonderful reviews of the Frontier one on Amazon.<br /><br />I was first apprehensive about the 'Organic Herbal Essence' - 'Frontier' mixup but when I saw a big red rimmed label with "Frontier" in green on the bag along with USDA Organic & Fair Trade mark/logos among other print, I quickly opened the bag and took out a spoonful of the powder to examine. I was slightly disappointed in the color, as I've read that dutch-processed cocoa powder had a deeper and sometimes redder color. I took out my box of natural, unsweetened Trader Joes cocoa powder and saw that the dutch-processed cocoa was darker and slightly redder in color in comparison, though not as much as I had hoped (and certainly not as deep as the picture on Amazon).<br /><br />I've also read that dutch-processed cocoa has a richer 'chocolatier' fragrance to it and so I took a whiff from the bag. To my dismay, a medicinal, acidic, spicey smell met my unsuspecting nose. I once again grabbed my Trader Joe's unalkalized cocoa powder and it smelled more 'chocolatier' than the Frontier bag. The expiration date is sometime in 2014 so I believe I either got a bad bag or this product is definitely not up to the hype. I even tried to mix some in my cup of coffee, as another reviewer had and raved about, and it tasted so.. 'off' and unappealing I had to mix in some sugar (I dont usually sweeten my coffee) and gulp down the rest (I hate wasting food and the coffee beans were kind of expensive heh).<br /><br />I'm still searching for a good dutch-processed cocoa powder, which is more difficult to find than I had hoped.. Thinking of looking into E Guittard, Pernigotti, or Green & Black next, at the recommendation of others, and Penzeys or Valrhona as last resorts (not available where I live and shipping is a killer). I'd suggest anyone looking for dutch-processed cocoa powder to skip this product and try the next option instead.

### Good cafe mocha, but "Chocolate Glazed Donut?" Come on!
It's not bad, but let's call it what it is: cafe mocha.  Calling it Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee is like what the yogurt companies do when their products aren't selling well, so they call "lime" something like "Mom's Key Lime Pie," or "vanilla" something like "Decadent Madagascar Vanilla Experience."  This coffee doesn't have a bad taste, but reminds me of putting a bit of chocolate sauce or syrup in my coffee.  What in it is reminiscent of "donut?"

I rescued three cats that were suffering from malnutrition.  I started feeding them wellness canned chicken cat food in small portions mixed with organic chicken broth.  I fed them a  few times a day, and within  a week they had more energy, and were putting on weight.  Within a month their coat was soft and shinny.  These cats did a total turn around and I believe that this fine food saved their lives.  I continued feeding the cats this food  because I am confident that the high protein and natural antioxidants will keep my cats healthy and it will also keep the cats hydrated.

I'm actually sitting at my desk drinking my first cup of Baronet Decaf Chocolate Fudge Coffee and let me tell you, it's good!  It's smooth, rich and wonderfully satisfying.  If you like coffee and chocolate, then this combination is for you.  I started out drinking it black (not something I usually do) just to get an idea about the flavor and it was smooth enough to drink just like that.  However, adding a little hazelnut creamer notched it up to an entirely different level.  Order it on Subscribe and Save and save even more money.  Great coffee!

### Didn't Suit My Palette
I ordered this hoping to use it while bicycling extensively in between bottles of water. However, the first one I had I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish the product. It didn't taste good to me at all. I had to chug it as quickly as possible and deal with the feeling of nausea for a couple of minutes from drinking so quickly. I can't comment on the usefulness of the drink because I was not inclined to drink it while riding. I ended up managing to drink all but three. I simply could not force myself to drink them all.<br /><br />I can't give the product one star because I know a lot of people don't have a problem with the taste. The packaging was good and the product was fresh, so I am giving it three stars despite my disliking the taste.

At least half the cans in my last order arrived in a crushed condition; not just dented but caved in. The inner and outer cardboard cartons that they were packed in were not damaged, so the cans had to have been damaged at the time the cartons were packed by the manufacturer, and not damaged during shipping. The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them. Perhaps disposing of such product through Amazon.com rather than taking a charitable writeoff is a more cost effective strategy for a manufacturer. Buyer beware when buying products sight unseen.

I bought this on a whim one day as I was craving nuts and well first of all, I found out six packages was a bit too much for one person. lol.<br /><br />Secondly, I thought I would get a walnut that was you know, the traditional picture of a walnut, kinda looks like a H and roughly 2/3 an inch long about 1/2 inch wide. Well what I got was a round ball that kinda resembled a walnut when you bit into it. It appears they crushed the walnut, dropped it into some sugary coating and cooked them. The result is not the traditional appearance, but still tastes alright. A bit too sweet though.<br /><br />So go ahead and order it but just be aware. Oh and you might have to share. lol

I was a little worried about this one because of a bad (weak coffee) experience w/ the My K-Cup, but this product worked remarkably well!  I didn't think it was difficult to clean using the spray nozzle on the faucet.  Also, be careful not to use super fine grounds (as suggested on the package).  They will plug up the mesh and result in a half brew of coffee so strong it can not be consumed!  Kirkland 100% Columbian-fine ground works well, however.

### dogs love it
The lickety stick is not a lollipop.  It is a roller that looks similar to roll on deodorant or shoe polish.  Inside is the flavored juice.  When the dog's tongue licks the roller, the juice coats it and the dog gets a taste.  I was sent the liver flavor.  One of my dogs loved it.  He was slow at first, but once the roller got coated with the flavored juice, he just went at it.  He even tried biting it. I had a hard time getting it away from him.  My other dog was afraid of it.  I think he thought it was medicine.<br />So this is an interesting way to give a dog a treat. Kind of fun to sit there and watch him lick it like a lollipop.  My only complaint is the smell was gross.  The bacon flavor would probably smell better.

### Excellent Coconut Oil
I use this oil in cooking. I've made muffins, cake, pancakes using this instead of butter - all turned out excellent and the recipes didn't require any finagling. It does impart a coconutty scent to a dish though I don't think that the flavor itself is noticeable. I especially like using this for stir-fries. It holds up to heat well and gives an extra dimension to the many scents/flavors in asian dishes. It pairs really nicely with lots of chili and lime.<br /><br />I also use the oil as a body moisturizer. It is absolutely wonderful for the skin after a shower. I've even used it on my hair. a little goes a long way but i like to smear it on when still in the shower and dry some of it off. Its also great for the lips throughout the day.

### Simply Wonderful
I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk...drinking it this way makes me more aware of the subtle differences between tea brands and "flavors."<br /><br />Even with all the herbal teas available, Earl Grey will always be my favorite tea. The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey has just the right amount of bergamot. When I opened the individual foil-wrapped bag, the orange aroma hit me first...not overpowering, but rather inviting. This was a surprise because I've had some Earl Greys that had so much bergamot, I couldn't detect any other aromas.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth, and I've enjoyed every cup, but the real test was with my mother. She's always complained that many Earl Grey teas at our local store are so weak that she has to saok more than one bag per cup, but she loved Higgins & Burke!!

Need I say more.  The only problem with them is stopping.  You too?<br /><br />They were my morning treat in the service.  A truck rolled up around 10 and my standard was the 6 Lorna Doone sleeve and the large coffee.  25-cents BTW<br /><br />FIVE STAR DOWN TO ONE!!!!<br />Added 3/12: Well, I just got another deal.  Seems affordable with deals and anything but when not featured.  The above indicates a lifelong relationship.  I should know the taste.  This case of cookies is different and not a good different.  Even the texture is off.<br /><br />The expiration date appears to be 14May12.  Still in spec but close and if poorly stored you get rancid.  The price was almost $2/box cheaper and close to grocery store prices.  I have figured out why it went from $50+ to 30's.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT I WENT TO AMAZON RETURNS AND THIS ITEM IS NOT ELIGIBLE.  AMAZON ALWAYS IMPRESSED ME ON RETURNS.  DISAPPOINTING. VERY DISAPPOINTING!  These went from a lovely treat to a reward for my dog.

### Pleased, But......
I have purchased this item before with the hopes, each time, of getting the sour cream chips in the box, but once again, there is not sour cream chips. I know it advertises either BBQ chips or sour cream chips, but has anyone ever gotten the sour cream chips included in the BIG GRAB box? I gave the product 5 stars because the bags are fresh and it was delivered on time and the proper packaging prevented the product from being crushed. Good job!

### Great stuff if you drink lots of margaritas
I was skeptical of using a sugar free mix to make drinks, and to be sure, it's not like getting a margarita made with fresh-pressed lime juice.  But, if you drink a lot of these in the summer, give this a try. Getting rid of the guilt along with the calories makes up for the slightly bitter taste. Don't bother, though, if you have one every once in a while and enjoy the real stuff instead.

My fiance bought me a Keurig last Christmas and I have been trying many different brands.  This one is my favorite and the first one I've decided to re-order.  I am a bit of a coffee addict, and I'm pretty picky about the right flavor when it comes to coffee.  If you having trouble finding a brand I would highly recommend trying this one.

### It's true...this coffee is divine.
I've had my Keurig for a few years now and have been trying all sorts of coffees.  Cinnamon Pastry is the best I've tasted so far for a flavored coffee.  It smells great too.  A little half and half or Coffee-mate added doesn't lose or alter the cinnamon flavor and makes it a little more decadent.  Yummy!

### Pretty good - the best I've found
These are the best food color markers that I can find - the color is true, the tip reasonably fine. But it is a very wet marker, and doesn't make a crisp line. I just wish I could find a TRULY fine-tip food color marker or even a pen, especially in black; stencil and drawing projects would be so much easier (as it is, a fine paintbrush and gel color is the only thing that'll do that job). Still, these beat Wilton hands-down (which isn't hard, because Wilton is AWFUL).

### Buster Loves Yogurt and Apples
We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!

### Best dog food ever!
I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.

### Very convenient, a little pricey
If you love espresso, but are always on the run, this is a great product. I am a huge coffee drinker, and this, plus the other version with low fat milk, and a little sugar, are both great. I love the option to grab this, black and unsweetened, or the if in the mood, the lightly sweetened version, when running around with no time to brew my own. The quality is very high, and I gave this 4 stars, instead of 5, only because it is very expensive. If the high price is offset by the convenience, as it is for me, give this, or actually any of the illy coffees a try, they are all great. Also, travels with you very easily, as a few of the 6.8 ounce size cans can go in a briefcase, or any bag with ease.

### This stuff is great!
What this is:  coconut water - not coconut milk - flavored with chocolate.<br /><br />Coconut water is taken from green coconuts - they haven't had the time to form the meat or milk yet.  Plain coconut water is cloudy-clear, and doesn't quite taste like coconuts.  It's packed with electrolytes, and doesn't carry a lot of calories.  I like Zico's plain coconut water better than most of their competitors plain product.<br /><br />This chocolate flavor is excellent imho.  It's not horribly sweet - kind of like a dark chocolate drink.<br /><br />Price compare: the local chain store (with the bulls-eye logo) has the plan or flavored bottles at about $2.50 each, so this is a good ten bucks cheaper (as of 22jul12) than the local market, and I don't have to drive over to get it.<br /><br />Among the big benefits for me is it provides a good helping of potassium, about as much as a banana, and is not loaded with sodium.<br /><br />About me:  I don't see anything special about delivering what you promise so I very rarely give "5"-star reviews.

### Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.
Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.  I presume that the right kind of machine, or the right style of coffeemaking, turns these packets into solid gold for ease of use; for me, though, not so much.  But yeah: seriously tasty coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee-ness in your hot water.
