machine learning,program to machine learns by itself with previous data
machine learning,"training computers to learn to do something rather than prescribing how to do it; categorize, label, predict"
machine learning,"teaching machines, systems, and devices to think more like we do"
machine learning,"the use of recursive methods in data processing, analysis, and generation that attempt to mimic the neural networks of synapses in the human brain"
machine learning,essentially teaching software to independently learn content and extrapolate on it by applying algorithms and a lot of data
machine learning,"programmatic, automated decision making from experience"
machine learning,"a computational process that uses quantitative methods to handle data that helps the user make predictions, sort information, demonstrate relationships, and visualize systems. the process involves allowing the computer to learn over time. "
machine learning,a set of instructions and patterns that allow a computer to predict and analyze information
machine learning,creating algorithms for a computer to run that will self correct when faced with a new problem
machine learning,to write algorithms that are able to make computers automatically produce outcomes that the programmer wants
machine learning,"the process of creating a model where a computer, through the use of algorithms, and data, learns how to achieve a specific test through trial and error"
machine learning,machine could learn something like data and predict other similar data based on the previous data
machine learning,"statistical and computational methods that involve computers or machines making decisions based on a previous set of knowledge or information, and inferences on that information"
machine learning,predicting future phenomena by creating probabilities between the likelihood of an outcome versus what has come prior
artificial intelligence,"intelligence stored, utilized, and created in a database and used by a machine to solve its objective"
artificial intelligence,"when a computer is able to learn, understand, and store things that it wasn't explicitly taught; it is as if the computer develops an imagination"
artificial intelligence,"regarding machine learning, it is not difference in kind, but scale; I don't think there's much ineffable about human intelligence but understand assuming we are all state machines is a bit reductionist for some"
artificial intelligence,"constructed cognition of machines, oftentimes based on prior knowledge of the methods of human cognition"
artificial intelligence,a field in computer science where there's research on how machines can acquire cognitive and other skills so it can resemble more how the human mind works
artificial intelligence,a computer system that is capable of autonomous thought with more or less than human level intelligence
artificial intelligence,"any intelligence of non-human, non-animal existence. I cannot say all artificial intelligences are constituted by digital language; they have their own language to recognize, understand, and present something"
artificial intelligence,computationally modeled behavior meant to emulate an organism
artificial intelligence,a virtual system of connected bodies of knowledge (i.e. databases) that is able to quickly reference and provide queries requested
