Text:  Although packaging was perfectly intact, three of the four cans received were badly dented. This gives me the impression that the seller is intentionally selling dented cans of the product. I would buy this product again but only from a store where undamaged merchandise can be visually inspected before purchase. Selling damaged merchandise is not good customer service.

Summary: The best dog food
Text:  This is a phenomenal pet food.  I have used it for 5 years with two dogs and it's wonderful.  First, they think that it's delicious of course and eagerly eat it day in and day out. Second, it's been crucial for my pet's health.  Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth.  After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix.  Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins.  We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food.  He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great.  He loves it and it has kept his gut stable.  Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food.  We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food.  Highly recommend.  It's pricey but as someone else said, cheaper than the vet bills!

Summary: Good with blueberry muffins or scones
Text:  This has a natural flavor to it, not artificial at all, and some of the K-cups do have a serious artificial note (as does almost every flavored coffee seller). This tastes great when it's accompanying any hot blueberry breakfast- pancakes or waffles with blueberries would be nice served with this coffee, too. It's definitely a milder coffee, but it still tastes like coffee. I drink it w/ a couple teaspoons of raw sugar & a couple teaspoons of Coffeemate, and enjoy it even served alone. Not my everyday coffee, but since I love blueberry muffins, it's one I like to keep on hand. If you like flavored coffee, coffee in general & blueberries, I think you'd enjoy this.

Summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
Text:  The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

Summary: Different! New!
Text:  Please excuse the first part of this review being the same as the review for the Kiwi Berry flavor, but the facts are the same for both products.<br /><br />I always enjoy reviewing a new product wondering what I will find, so I was pleased when given the opportunity to review "Switch."  What is "Switch," a new refreshing drink  that will dazzle you.<br /><br /> The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink,but has a catchy saying - "100% of what you want 0% of what you don't."  What does that mean?  According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink, especiall children.  But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, nor will our children, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />BLACK CHERRY SWITCH:<br /><br />It was definitely full of the rich flavor of cherry.  If you like that taste you will truly like this one.  It isn't sweet, tends to be on the tart side and has a little punch to it, which was nice in a way, but to me a little overpowering.  Since it was carbonated you felt as if you were drinking a soda, but you were not.  The flavor was pleasant and the drink refreshing, not as good as the Kiwi that I tried, but  different than other drinks which makes it fun.  I don't think I would purchase the cherry flavor of this drink however for personal use, but to each their own. If you want a different drink, that appears to be healthier than soda, Switch is for you.

Text:  I've been told that Vita Coco had a strange taste and sure enough I liked it!  I like trying new things and when told about the benefits of this magical drink I bought in.  The 'Natural' way to replenish your fluids etc!  Whenever I drink Vita Coco I 'feel' like it revitalizes me.. or it could be the placebo affect.. however, do believe this tonic works. Just wondering if I can go to the local Asian grocer and pick up a case of the cheaper coconut drinks and get the same affects.  I took a look at a label of a Chinese product and it had DIFFERENT nutritional values.  My guess is that they don't try to hype the nutritional value?  Either way just a consideration for frugal consumers here on Amazon..  sorry for the rant.  I just feel these drinks are pricey and have decided to NOT keep purchasing these drinks as an incorporated regiment in my diet.. OK enough ranting, now review to completion..<br /><br />So signed up with the subscribe and save and received two large cases for several months.  The first shipment was delish!  Quite wonderful taste, refreshing, and as I expected.  Now when I received the second shipment the drink was quite different..  Seemed like there was more sugar and had a strange coconut flavor.  Seemed like someone put some additives to the jungle punch..  Well this has guided me to consider the Asian grocer coconut drinks and to do research on their nutritional benefits.  More than likely will not keep drinking coconut water.. more than likely going to have it sporadically.<br /><br />Happy purchases!

But there's little else about these little crackers to rave about. Why? Because they are almost flavorless. I'm not someone who uses much salt.  You won't catch me even touching the salt shaker during a meal, and I probably go through less than 2 ounces of the stuff in an average year of cooking at my house. But I found myself wanting to pull out a salt shaker and sprinkle some of the stuff in the bag, then shaking it so the crackers might at least have a chance of acquiring some taste. I don't know if I got a bad case of these or what (certainly all the other posted raves make me wonder), but I won't be buying them again.

It tastes exactly like coffee, nothing over the top, just coffee. I gave it 4 stars though because it is organic, and I prefer everything organic!

Summary: Best rice-free granola bars!
Text:  I'm allergic to rice and it's crazy difficult to find granola bars without rice (or rice flour, etc...). And thankfully, these are my favorite flavor, peanut butter! I searched high and low for something like this and now my local Fred Meyers stopped carrying them so I had to go online. They are crunchy with a good oatmeal peanut butter taste - salty and sweet but not too sweet. Alot like Nature Valley peanut butter granola bars sans rice. Great for breakfast or to bring along on a hike. Yum!  If anyone knows of any other good rice free granola bars, let me know...  Thanks!

Text:  yes, that's right, our family has 10 cats (all rescues), so you can imagine I was pretty stoked when this product came up for review.<br /><br />Now, since I have so many cats, my cats normally only get can food as a treat, maybe once a month. About a third LOVE can food, a third can take it or leave it, and the last third do not like can food at all. When I tried this product on my cats, over two thirds gobbled it up, only one or two showed no interest, and one (who has a sensitive stomach anyway) got sick within five minutes of consumption.<br /><br />The product has a lot of "juice", which I find my cats tend to enjoy. The smell wasn't overpowering like many cat foods.<br />In conclusion, I'd buy Petite Cuisine for my cats but only as a treat.<br />3.5 stars.

Summary: A tad too sweet for my taste
Text:  Izze makes some very good juices, and advertises that their juice contains nothing other than fruit juice and sparkling water.  These are undoubtedly far, far better for you than, say, a Coke or a Pepsi.  They taste better and are more refreshing, and they certainly have a more natural feel to them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like many juices that claim to be all fruit juice, the vast majority of the juice in this particular blend appears to be apple and grape, which are much sweeter fruits in comparison with the tarter flavors.  Everyone knows pomegranate is good for you, but my guess is that the percent of this juice that is actual pomegranate is quite small--perhaps as low as 2 or 3 percent--and so contrary to what other reviewers have said, any health advantages are quite minimal.<br /><br />All that being said, these are certainly a superior option to other soft drinks.  Just don't think these are as good as water.

However, it was evident with my first handful that there was way too much salt and pepper for my taste.  Maybe that was a good thing because it slowed down the momentum of how I usually eat cashews. Each time I had more, I had to wet a paper towel to soak up the excess seasoning.<br /><br />I quite imagine that for recipes that call for cashews, the pre-seasoning would probably be a welcomed addition.

He's a bigger chewer now but at the time he was not the most ferocious, and it would last maybe 8 minutes now.  No mess on the floor - little nibbled bits that stick to your socks - like you get with real bones.  No loose stool either, but there were some FUNKY smells going on in his vicinity a few hours after each bone.<br /><br />For a more durable chew without the stinkies, try an antler.  I'll post a review on those if I can find them in my order history.<br /><br />Based on the dogs I've owned, this would be great for a Sheltie, spaniel, bichon or other small- to midsize- puppy that isn't a serious chewer but needs a job to do to keep him out of trouble.

One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.

It's basically a coconut cream made from organic dried coconut meat that is spreadable like butter (a little more gritty than butter, though).<br /><br />When I received it, I opened the container - the wonderful smell of coconut wafted up, but it had clearly melted and resolidified. I was quite hesitant at that point. Reading some reviews and suggestions on how to eat it, I warmed it in a bowl of warm water, then dipped my finger in for a taste.<br /><br />Wow. It is delish.<br /><br />It is also high in fat, so I will be using it sparingly, but it teaspoon goes well with my chia seeds for a breakfast, and I've used it to saute meat for some Thai dishes. I also added it to a strawberry smoothie - YUM!<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it's in a plastic tub, especially because it has to be heated to be used. I removed mine from the packaging it came in and placed it in a glass jar (which actually seems to reduce the warm water heat time).

When I sent in my six-pack order last month, I knew that I'd have to send me friend one of those packs. Her orange tabby cat is gone now, too, but her new kitten, whom she adopted even though - or perhaps because - he has only one eye, loves Kitty Kaviar as much as all of mine do. Great product.

Summary: Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn is too sweet for my taste
Text:  These popcorn tasted too sweet, even though the nutrition facts didn't show large amount of sugar or calories.<br /><br />I have enjoyed caramel popcorn (that come in large tin boxes during holidays) in the past, but unfortunately I didn't like these. Even our candy-loving child declared these are too sweet and it is hard to consume one whole packet. (May be that is a good thing.)<br /><br />None of the family members were enthusiastic about these snacks, we won't be purchasing these, and will not recommend to others.

Summary: FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain
Text:  These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times "healthy" or "good for you" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them.

Text:  The Mint Milano cookies are wonderful. They have a light and crispy texture with a mild mint chocolate taste. The flavor reminds me a lot of the chocolate mint Girl Scout cookies although the texture of the 2 cookies are very different (the girl scout cookie is much denser).<br /><br />Unfortunately the cookies usually arrive with very few intact and several of mine were even broken into multiple pieces. They still taste pretty good though.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts copied from the actual package (July 2011):<br /><br />Serving size 2 cookies (25g/ 0.9oz)<br /><br />Servings per container about 8<br /><br />Calories per serving 130<br /><br />Calories from fat 70<br /><br />Total Fat 7g<br /><br />Saturated Fat 5g<br /><br />Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol less than 5 mg<br /><br />Sodium 65mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber less than 1g<br /><br />Sugars 8g<br /><br />Protein 1g<br /><br />Vitamins A and C 0%<br /><br />Calcium 0%<br /><br />Iron 4%<br /><br />FYI, I purchased my cookies during 100 degree weather and except for some of the chocolate melting onto the inner wrapper the cookies were fine (I used 2 day shipping which might make a difference since the cookies weren't in the heat that long).<br /><br />At 15.88 for 4 bags of cookies the price per bag is 3.97 which is 48 cents more than the price printed on the cookie bag (3.49).

The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

Summary: Dark and Delicious
Text:  If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.<br /><br />When he moved back to Belgium he not only married his true love, he created chocolates the world now adores. When you taste these chocolates, your taste buds will also finally know true chocolate happiness. Whether you try one of these with a cup of coffee or tea or enjoy one as a daily indulgence, these will impress.<br /><br />If being "in love" gives you a zest for life, then the "I Love You" chocolate with dreamy lemon filling embodies this sentiment. Each chocolate has a unique design and the I Love You chocolate has two hearts, ribbons and a seal. After you sample the variety of chocolates, specific flavors will stand out as favorites.<br /><br />Here are my favorite creamy fillings (ganache and butter cream) which come in dark, white and milk chocolate depending on the selection (dark if you order this box):<br /><br />Antoinette - A smooth Brandy flavored ganache<br /><br />Lingoit Lait - Absolutely delicious vanilla flavored fresh butter cream filling. Time definitely stopped while tasting this chocolate.<br /><br />Irr&eacute;sistible - Dark chocolate and Strawberry sauce.<br /><br />For ever - If you love coffee this may be one of the most delicious milk or dark chocolate chocolates ever made as it is filled with a special coffee cream that has hints of caramel. I ordered an entire box of these and they come in a variety of flavors. The milk chocolate and cherry filling is like Claude Debussy's Rêverie. It is difficult to describe besides saying it is like a delicate cherry icing wrapped in milk chocolate.<br /><br />Merveilleux - Milk or dark chocolate filled with coffee ganache.<br /><br />Europe - Dark or milk chocolate filled with rum filling.<br /><br />Ganache - Milk or dark chocolate with pure ganache.<br /><br />Tosca - Milk chocolate with a special ganache.<br /><br />Po&eacute;sie - Dark chocolate and a Cointreau filling.<br /><br />Antoinette - Delicate caramel hints in the milk chocolate coating mingle nicely with the vanilla filling.<br /><br />Eve - Milk or dark chocolate with a creamy dreamy banana filling.<br /><br />Alexandre le grand - A milk or dark chocolate with caramel cream.<br /><br />Also Recommended:<br /><br />If you wish to also try the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. You may also want to look for the new Palet d'Or. A deeply delicious and strong bitter chocolate filled with ganache. The center is made with butter, cream and chocolate and the outer coating is a masterpiece with gold decorations.<br /><br />Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature/seasonal wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Summary: Actual theater popcorn -- this is it
Text:  I'm probably one of the most critical when it comes to replicating the movie theater experience at home.  You're looking at a guy whom has a motorized movie screen, projector, sound system, actual 4 head soda fountain and candy display.  So, matching the popcorn was a large task.  Initially I was stuck with buying popcorn and peanut oil.  Ya, it tasted good but no where near movie theater popcorn.  Then, I found Snappy Snappack's and Great Northern.  Greath Nothern was my first purchase.  I challenge you to read all the reviews on here.  I can assure you that those whom say the popcorn is too salty are correct.  The salt comes in a powder form mixed in with the seeds.  If you're careful you can separate the two with some effort.  Personally, I've gotten used to the salt but I can tell you that it is very salty.  The freshness wasn't a factor.  I have no doubt that others have gotten less than fresh popcorn.  Here's a warning:  when your package arrives, BE CAREFUL.  Don't just slice into it to open the box.  The people from amazon literally grab about 20 of the packets and drop them into a box.  I was at a city event where they were giving away free popcorn and snapped a picture of the popcorn they were using.  Snappy SnapPack: [...] This was not overly salted and tasted more like theater popcorn than great northern I think but they're both a toss up... it's super close.<br /><br />If you're unsure how big your kettle is... go by this: the 2.5oz is only good for one person.  The 2.5oz kettles are the ones you see like this:[...]<br /><br />You've seen them at places when you're out and about.  So in retrospect I should have gotten the 4.5oz one.  I have one of those small nostalgia popcorn cards.  2.5oz will fill up a large popcorn bucket about halfway.<br /><br />Another thing I like about this pre-packed popcorn is that it pretty much pops all the seeds.  When I used to pop popcorn from walmart popcorn and peanut oil it'd only pop about 50% of the seeds... the remaining seeds would fly out of the popper.<br /><br />There are some on here that talk about the buttery/oily mixture not looking fresh.  It does come as a semi-solid.  You don't need to kneed it, however.  Simply empty it into the kettle and it will melt on it's own.<br /><br />If you have any questions I'd love to answer them.  Just reply to this message.

Text:  This review is less about the cereal and more about the option of buying from Amazon for one of two reasons:<br /><br />1) If you've never had it, you're probably not going to buy a 4-pack.  More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.<br /><br />2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.<br /><br />I have a 4-pack delivered every month via "Subscribe & Save" and here's why:<br /><br />My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.<br /><br />The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!<br /><br />So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.  It doesn't take a college education to know that's a deal!

Summary: Delicious portable meal for both meat and non-meat eaters alike!
Text:  *Update*<br /><br />These are now in my regular lunch rotation, regardless of whether that's during the school year, or during summer. The meal presented in this kit is healthy AND delicious, and the perfect size for carrying aboard a long flight, on a road trip, or for a quick lunch at work. For me, Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature also adds an extra incentive to keep these on hand, with the 15% discount, $1.00 off coupon promo that's currently on for it, and the free shipping feature. SO many reasons to keep these around!<br /><br />* * * * *<br /><br />I got lucky enough to come across one of these at, of all places, my local TJ Maxx store. Having tried the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YBLF2E">GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> before, and enjoyed it, I was excited to see this one on the shelf, as it has the same dry roasted edamame in it that I've been craving since the salmon salad meal kit.<br /><br />Honestly, I think THIS one may be my favorite of the two!<br /><br />The first thing that I dove into was, of course, the lightly salted dry roasted edamame. As in my previous experience with them, they were super dry, and needed some liquid help getting to my belly, but they're tasty & filling enough that they still have me wanting more of them.<br /><br />The fruit and nut mix was delicious, but don't ask me to give you any details on what, exactly, I liked most about it, because I devoured it so quickly that, outside of the spicy & sweet kick of it, it's hard to give details. Just let it be said that if you're looking for a trail mix without too much sweet or salty, this will perfectly satisfy that craving, while adding a nice crunch from the nuts, chewiness from the flavored dried cranberries, and spicy bite from the pepper coating on the almonds. Delicious!<br /><br />There were no utensils in this GoPicnic box whatsoever, but the only thing I needed was a pair of scissors to snip a corner off of the hummus pouch. If you take this with you on a hike, you'll undoubtedly already be carrying either a Leatherman-type tool, or a Victorinox-style Swiss army knife, so either of those will have what you need. If you DON'T have a comparable tool with you, opening the hummus pouch might be a bit more laborious, but I can't imagine it'd be impossible. Since I like skinny lines of hummus or whatever I happen to be applying to a surface for consumption (horsey sauce at Arby's, mustard & catsup on my burger, etc., etc., etc.), I only cut off a small corner to ensure that I could get the thin lines of hummus that I wanted onto my Crunchmaster multigrain crackers (which, incidentally, I'd never had before, but am now in love with). The WildGarden Traditional flavored hummus (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IMSQ">Hummos-Single Serve Packet (10 Packets)</a> had a delightful tang, and was delicious! There was plenty to cover every Crunchmaster cracker, pieces and all, and still enough left to squeeze a generous dollop onto my finger for a final tangy treat.<br /><br />As always, the box contained a delicious, smooth square of dark chocolate that was just the right amount of sweet and tasty, without being too much of anything else. The box also had a Sudoku puzzle on the bottom of it, as had the box containing the salmon salad meal that I'd tried before.<br /><br />Overall, I'm finding that these GoPicnic meals are just right for me for a satisfying cold lunch at work when I don't have time to nuke anything before my next class, and I'm seriously considering subscribing to one of 'em, just to have 'em around. I honestly wish Amazon would make up a variety pack of these as an option, because, having liked both of the two that I've tried, I'm starting to think that I'd like 'em all!<br /><br />Delicious, convenient, AND healthy! This one covers all the bases!

Summary: Love at first bite!  Tongue-puckering tang and crunch!
Text:  I first discovered Kettle Chips with sea salt and vinegar while shopping at Trader Joe's with my daughter Mindy.  I couldn't believe how tasty they were; the best chip I had ever eaten.  It was love at first bite, and I've been munching them ever since.<br /><br />Other things in their favor: they're thicker than other chips, so don't crumble as I'm devouring them; they're delightfully crunchy; and the salt-and-vinegar combination is heavenly.  I tried to create an original line to describe this palate-pleasing taste treat, but couldn't beat what the manufacturer said: tongue-puckering tang and crunch.  Isn't that poetic?<br /><br />As for health values, since Kettle Chips are not peeled during preparation, I'm getting more nutrition, such as potassium and vitamin C.  My mother would approve of that, and the fact that they're hand-cooked in small batches.<br /><br />I often enjoy Kettle Chips as an afternoon snack with my favorite soda or iced tea, but they're also delicious with a tuna sandwich or a hot dog for lunch.  Well, actually Kettle Chips go perfect with everything ... except "sweets," of course.<br /><br />My only problem is that they're so delicious I can't stop eating them.  That's the reason I chose these smaller packets; I figured 24 could last me almost a month, if I was a good girl, kept my appetite under control--and hid them from the kids!  For the sake of fewer calories, I try hard and have succeeded so far.  It isn't easy, but ...<br /><br />Have I told you how much I love them?<br /><br />Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008<br />Millennium Babe: The Prophecy

Summary: A nice step up from plain rice cereal
Text:  Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.  This blend of fruit and grains (and, in some cases, yogurt) provides everything she needs for a good breakfast and keeps her full for several hours.  Plus, the flavors are not overly sweet.  One note:  at least two of these flavors include yogurt.  Some babies younger than 1-year may have a reaction to yogurt and other dairy foods, so just watch out for that.

Text:  I have to order more of this stuff. I've almost finished my first canister. Bottom line with this, it makes me feel good... and it keeps me regular. The taste is good. I have it with orange juice or just with water. Either way tastes great. Of course, it is more filling with orange juice. It is actually lick-your-lips good with orange juice. I mix it with about 4 oz juice or water. I was only taking it once a day. Now I've moved up to twice a day... first thing in the morning and in the late afternoon when I get home from work, I take a "shot" before I workout for a nice energy boost.

Summary: Good product, BPA fears no longer an issue
Text:  ****Latest Update****<br /><br />We are now past the baby food stage so I may have missed this if it was formally announced, but I recently heard that they switched packaging in late 2011 to be completely BPA free.  I confirmed this with customer service.  Leaving the remaining review as it was...<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />My wife had made her own baby food for our daughter for the first eight months. Then, when our daughter was going to begin daycare, there was a certain convenience factor of being about to send in jars of baby food for her and so we bought Earth's Best. It was organic, and figured to be the closest bought brand to what she had been making herself. The variety packs are a nice, easy way to stock different kinds for our baby to enjoy... and enjoy she did for several of the flavors, though some she hated as well. All in all, we were pleased, and baby seemed pleased, though I will say, she didn't seem to like these gourmet ones any better or any worse than the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM6LVS">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Dinner Variety Pack, 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was pretty surprised to read a review about BPA in the lids at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BM395E">Earth's Best Organic 2nd Fruit Variety Pack, 4-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12)</a>, (and so I posted my review there as well).  I spent some time trying to verify this myself. A lot of different blogs stated it, and while I couldn't find anything definitive, here's what bothered me: Clearly Earth's Best knows people are concerned about BPA in their lids... their own facebook site is littered with people asking this same question. The admin answers these the same way... food safety and baby health is of the highest priority, call us to discuss. That's only slightly paraphrased. Going to their website, they have zero articles on BPA and none in the FAQs section either... nothing. I'm not worried enough about the issue to stop using what we purchased, but I would have felt a whole lot better about the company and their products if they would acknowledge parents' concerns and tell parents... something. Hey, we check our food in laboratory testing regularly and the the amount of BPA found in our food is X, which is so low, there are no health concerns... just say something... anything. Do you really want the onus on the customer to contact you to keep using your product?<br /><br />As I was taking the time to review their product, I decided I would call them to give them a fair chance to explain. Something, I likely wouldn't have done if I wasn't writing a review. Their office was closed... 9AM - 7PM est. Not the most convenient times for a working parent, but I will attempt to follow up and update this accordingly.<br /><br />****UPDATED (old)****<br />Just spoke to someone from customer service.  She says that the liner that comes into contact with the food is BPA free, but that there is another section of the lid behind this liner, that does contain BPA, but that section of the lid does not come in contact with the food.  I'm sure not everyone will be okay with that answer, but I'm ok with it.  I still think it should be an answer that's readily available to consumers without calling them, but I will say there was no hold time at least.

Summary: I've finally found "my" bar
Text:  I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company. There are always at least a few kinds in there, ones that I've tried before and like and ones that I'm trying out for the first time. I finally got around to trying Kind Bars after all this time, and this specific flavor is officially on my "that's it, you've found a gold medal winner" list.<br /><br />There's usually something for my picky side to take issue with, but not this time. I love that they have extra protein, as they really manage to leave me feeling full and satisfied if I end up turning to one in place of lunch. The fact that it was packed with nuts made me suspect that I would find it too crunchy, but it has the perfect level of chewiness with a really pleasing-but-not-overpowering crunch. Unlike their sister bars (Passion Fruit Macadamia + B Complex, which I purchased at the same time) these are not cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, they have sweetness, but I find that it's just the right amount-- you're tasting the nuts and other good things with just a bump of sweetness to help it along.<br /><br />I bought one box to try them out, now I'm back to load up on them while they are on sale. I'm going to be keeping these as my main bar with one or two other favorites for occasional variety. If you are the kind of person that is always on the lookout for a quick meal or snack fix, I really can't recommend this specific bar more!

Summary: Outstanding flavor, great price!
Text:  After years of using Starbuck's decaf and regular single serving espresso pods, I finally found a substitute that's more economical and MUCH better tasting.<p>I've used three different brands of pods in my Starbuck's Barista machine, and have found that the quality of the pod and the flavor of the espresso inside is, by far, the best in the Espressione pods. The flavor is more full bodied and stronger than in the Starbuck's pods. I actually use one pod to make two shots of espresso, and the flavor is more intense than when I buy my specialty drinks from Starbucks or other coffee houses.<p>Also, the pod itself is of very high quality. Each pod is individually wrapped in an airtight, hard foil wrapper, and I've never opened a package yet that contained a torn pod with coffee spilling out. Such is not the case with other lesser brands.<p>The tab on each pod is also handy, making it easier to switch out a hot spent pod with a new one when making a second round of espresso.

Summary: Rich and flavorful - even from the "wrong" pot!
Text:  I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.

Summary: This is THE BOMB on Salmon!!
Text:  All you need to make THE BEST SALMON is to sprinkle a little of this on one side of the salmon, and bake/broil the requisite time.  In my infrared toaster oven (which cooks faster than most traditional ones... you may have to up to double the time in those),  I simply put some aluminum foil on the small tray, lay the salmon fillets down on that, sprinkle a little Zatarains Creole seasoning on the top, then put it in on 425 for about 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!  And incredibly easy!!<br /><br />I've tried other Creole seasonings to make Salmon, and the two I've tried didn't even come close.<br /><br />AND, salmon is pretty forgiving, so if you overcook it a bit, no big deal, it'll still be good.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be so thankful you did, and will not bother with all the hassle of mixing special sauces for your salmon.  When I go out to a restaurant, I rarely ever order the salmon, because I regularly make better (almost always) at home for a lot less money.

If you're not going to buy the healthier stuff for yourself, DO IT FOR YOUR KIDS! I did look into purchasing the import brands but it is TWICE the cost!!  I compared the nutritional value and it is virtually the same! Hodgkins Mill had 0.5g of saturated fat compared to McCanns -0-, but Hodgkins had 10% of daily iron compared to their 6%.  So, in the end the good and the bad kind of balanced out.  So come on people, feed your family the healthy stuff and keep our dollars in the USA rather than sending it off to another country!

Summary: Nice old fashioned sandwich bags
Text:  How do you review a brown lunch sandwich bag?  To start - it's large enough for an overstuffed sandwich.  I love the crinkle sound of the bag, it holds a crease at the top.  It is going to make the same old sandwiches seem to take on a new life with this new bag - nostalgic. It will be good to put muffins I bake in the 'donut hole maker' into this for quick grab snacks.  This won't cause any moisture mushiness like a plastic wrap will.  No waxy feel - all biodegradable.  I like it.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 13: I've been using these bags since they arrived...they are wonderful.  My brother gives them 5 stars.  I make him 2 sandwiches a day, one for breakfast and one for lunch.  When he returns home, I notice he carefully folds the bags up for me to reuse.  I can use the same 2 bags, every day, for a week without a problem.  They are sturdy and hold up well.  Even with crinkles in the paper, they still hold a good crease.  I make the sandwiches the night before and they don't dry out nor become soggy in the fridge over-night or until his last sandwich at lunch.  I notice when I use plastic wrap or foil he throws those away...these bags are nicely folded and brought back home, so I guess they are a money-saver in the long run.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 22, 2012:  It's been a year since first trying these bags.  I've upped the stars from 4 to 5 stars.  I absolutely love this product.  It's come in handy for so many things.  It works almost like parchment paper, too.  I've baked in these for wrapped meals, knowing it is all safe against foods.  Tomorrow I'm trying large diced potatoes, cheese and bacon put into the bag - pop into an oven and bake about 45 minutes at 350, top with fresh green onions (scallions).  So many uses for these bags.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 23, 2012: Do not use these as a substitute for parchment paper.  When I cooked the potatoes in the bag with cheese and bacon - the cheese stuck!  I think it would have been okay had I not used cheese.  I invested in their parchment paper: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZIC8I">If You Care 100% Unbleached Silicone Parchment Paper, 70-Foot Roll (Pack of 4)</a> and will use this either alone or added into the sandwich bags when I bake with them.  The sandwich bags did hold up well in a 425 degree toaster oven.<br /><br />**I LOVE their paper cupcake liners.  I have the large and Jumbo. (large equals a standard sized muffin cup)  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAIR96">If You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>  NOTHING sticks to these at all.  Your baking cup paper will peel right off of your cupcakes and muffins with ease, never tearing at even the most delicate cakes. I give a box for a little gift when visiting.  These are the best and with the initial investment you won't be buying them for a long time.  The brown paper is excellent for us adults who are tired of fake inks and cutesy flowers...the color is very becoming and stays the same before and after the oven.  I love the "If You Care" brand.

That initiative will give them the gift of a longer, healthier life, eliminate many chronic health issues that pets face, save you money in vet bills in the long run... the list of benefits goes on and on.<br /><br />I have done extensive research on canine and feline nutrition and I highly recommend, if you are going to feed commercial food, Welless, California Naturals or Innova. For a great complete meal, I give my dogs all one of those dry foods mixed with a little bit of canned from the same brands, water for hydration, a touch of a good quality essential oil (such as olive, flax, etc.), a touch of powdered kelp and alfalfa, a splash of organic apple cider vinegar, Prozyme digestive enzymes to unlock the nutrients in all that good food and top with a dollop of plain yogurt. It sounds like a lot, but it takes me less than 5 minutes to assemble the meals for 6 dogs - and they are ridiculously healthy an full of energy, even our 3 seniors who are 11, 12 and 13. I have two seniors with heart murmurs and at our most recent vet check, my dog with the worst heart murmur, a 12 year old beagle that I love desperately, had a 2-grade improvement in condition severity - that is HUGE.

Summary: Buyer beware, Proctor & Gamble has ruined this food!
Text:  My girlfriend and I have been rescuing, fostering, and adopting out (through a rescue group) cats and kittens for over 10 years. We also have a number of feline companions that live with us and bring us a lot of joy. So we're very experienced in all aspects of cat care, and we always try to feed our feline companions high quality foods. The foods are more expensive, but worth it for the health and well-being of our beloved companions!<br /><br />We had been using Innova Cat & Kitten Dry Cat Food for several years, once we discovered that it included no by-products, corn filler, or other junk ingredients. Our cats loved the food, which we mixed with another high quality dry food for variety.<br /><br />Fast forward to our experiences over the last few months. We heard that Proctor & Gamble, manufacturer of IAMS and other junk cat foods, had purchased Natura Pet Products, maker of the Innova, Healthwise, and California Natural brands, among others. Proctor & Gamble has questionable pet food testing practices (search the internet for it), so we naturally never buy their products and do not want to support the company in any way. So we were very upset about P&G's purchase of Natura, but we stuck with the Innova Cat & Kitten food for the short run, hoping we could later find a better alternative.<br /><br />Well strangely enough, for the last 10 or so 15lb bags of Innova Cat & Kitten that we've purchased, something has changed. The food is much more "crumbly", i.e. there is a lot more "food dust" in the bags, and the kibble looks a little different. We didn't think much of this change until our cats, which had previously LOVED the Innova food, lost interest in it and really didn't want to eat it. In the dry food mix we make, we noticed that very often, the cats would eat the other part of the mix, and leave the Innova Cat & Kitten behind. Clearly there is something different about the way P&G manufactures this food, as opposed to how it USED to be made by Natura Pet Products.<br /><br />This is EXPENSIVE food, and for the money you pay, it should be TOP QUALITY. Well, it ISN'T anymore! We finally reached our boiling point one day when we looked around at all the cat food bowls (which are usually totally empty after feeding time), and saw that much of the Innova part of the mix was leftover, unwanted.<br /><br />So that was it; we returned our last 3 large bags of Innova Cat & Kitten to the store we'd purchased them from, and will never buy this food again. In fact, we've now decided to never buy ANY Natura products, which include Healthwise and California Natural. We did find a good quality alternative cat food called "Simply Nourish", and when we tried it with our cats, they LOVED it. There is no longer ANY food leftover in their bowls, and we know the new food we are feeding is good quality.<br /><br />WARNING: For anyone currently purchasing "Innova Cat & Kitten", or planning to buy it in the future, we believe that P&G appears to have changed the way this food is made, for the worse. We can only assume that this large company was trying to save money, and in so doing have ruined one of the formerly best brands of food on the market. AVOID this food, it does NOT appear to contain the same formula/ingredients as it was before P&G bought Natura Pet Products, and ruined it!

Summary: The graphic is the best thing
Text:  I was not expecting a large box, but this is teeny tiny! The graphic is cute, but that's not what I thought I was paying for. I had sent some as gifts before I saw one in person -- they weren't supposed to be big gifts, but when I saw how small they actually were I was mortified. Part of the fun of a gift like this is the feeling of expansive celebration -- but, despite the colorful packaging, this just seems stingy.

Text:  I read about the fat content on the Larabar site, which said: "What about the fat in L&Auml;RABAR? Plant-based fats are healthier than animal fats. The fat in L&Auml;RABAR comes primarily from nuts-all plant-based fats containing Omega 3 & 6 essential fatty acids, which have been proven to reduce LDL cholesterol and help protect the heart."  I read all the reviews before making this purchase and I was amazed at how misleading PEN PAL's, review was (they said: "LARABARS HAVE 45 - 55 % FAT! 200 + CALORIES!").  It sounded scary.<br /><br />Olive oil is good for you, but no matter what, the calories from fat (9 calories per gram) are going to be the same whether it is from bad sources of fat or good sources.  The calories from this product are from good sources and that is what counts.  Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.  I'd give these delicious bars a try and fit them into your food management routine any way you see fit!  It definitely goes in the good food category for sure.  Don't hate the fat, hate the lack of discipline and they are a tempting yummy. :)

Summary: One of the best no calorie sweeteners available
Text:  I've tried pretty much all the no calorie and low calorie sugar substitutes available. None of them are perfect. Don't expect anything to taste exactly like sugar except sugar because there is nothing that tastes exactly like sugar except for sugar. That is a fact. The human taste buds, especially in certain individuals, are extremely sensitive to the various flavors each sweetener provides. Often sweeteners are compared to sugar, but in reality high calorie sugar substitutes like fructose even taste different from sugar. So please stop comparing other sweeteners to sugar, because only sugar tastes exactly like sugar, and attempting to find a sweetener with a different molecular structure that tastes exactly like sugar is impossible because the human taste buds can sense even the slightest difference in the molecular structure of the sweetener.<br /><br />Now with that said, there are today available many sweeteners each with their own positive and negative attributes. The number one sweetener in the world is sugar, and most people find sugar to be the best tasting sweetener. That's why it's number one. The low calorie alternatives include both natural sweeteners (erythritol, stevia, xylitol, lo han, etc.) and man-made sweeteners (nutrasweet, saccharine, splenda, etc.).<br /><br />This product is a mix of the three natural sweeteners erythritol, isomaltulose, and reb A (a sweetener extracted from stevia), as well as natural flavors to make the taste more like sugar.<br /><br />Erythritol is a great all natural low calorie sweetener on it's own, but it lacks depth, and imparts sort of a watery sweetness unless mixed with other sweeteners. It goes very well with stevia, and is commonly found mixed with stevia based sweeteners, as is the case in this product. The combination greatly enriches the sweetness of each of the two distinct sweeteners.<br /><br />Stevia normally contains stevioside, reb A (rebaudioside A), reb C (rebaudioside C), and dulcoside A. Of these, reb A is the most desirable, sweetest, and lacks the bitterness of the others. Most high quality stevia products contain mostly reb A. Reb A on it's own has a shallow but pleasant sweetness. It's a sharp sweetness and goes very well with other sweeteners that help broaden it's sweetness such as xylitol, erythritol, sugar, lo han, etc. The fact that PureVia only uses reb A from stevia means that it has none of the bitter aftertaste of some of the other popular stevia products available.<br /><br />Isomaltulose is a full calorie sweetener very similar to sugar but like erythritol and reb A it does not promote tooth decay. It's presence helps to give PureVia a richer full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Ok, so those are the facts, but how does it actually stand up against the other sweeteners available? The taste is excellent. Most of the people I know who've tried it like it a lot. It has a flavor very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners out there, it has its own unique flavor. There is no bitter aftertaste or unnatural chemical taste present. It's sweetness is full bodied, not thin or watery. The manufacturers did a fantastic job of mixing the various sweeteners together to produce a rich full bodied sweetness. It has none of the drawbacks of most common stevia products (a thin flavor, bitter aftertaste), none of the drawbacks of erythritol (watery sweetness), and to top it off its all natural. What natural flavors are added are of course a trade secret, and these are partially responsible for PureVia's flavor being very similar to sugar.<br /><br />PureVia is simply one of the best sugar substitutes you can buy. There are a few others that are as good (such as NuStevia and Truvia), but each one has its own unique flavor. Not everyone is going to agree on which one is the best tasting because each person has their own taste preferences.<br /><br />I really like PureVia's individual tube packets better than those of most other products. They are easier to use. They are tubes rather than flat envelopes. This makes it much easier to dispense.<br /><br />One bit of advice, if you're very picky about a full bodied sweetness, no matter which sweetener you prefer, using more than one sweetener nearly always improves the flavor profile. For example, a mix of splenda, nutrasweet, and saccharine will give a more full bodied flavor than each one can alone. The same is true for the natural sweeteners. Sugar and fructose together give a richer taste when combined together. Stevia and lo han give a richer taste when combined together. In general, the more sweeteners you combine, the richer the taste. You can get a sweetness that is better than sugar alone by mixing different sweeteners together. Also keep in mind that natural low calorie sweeteners like stevia and lo han vary dramatically from one brand to another, with the more refined ones generally being the most expensive and best tasting.<br /><br />A combination I often use is saccharine mixed with a stevia based sweetener (such as PureVia, NuStevia, Sun Crystals, etc.). Saccharin was once thought to cause cancer in humans, but this is no longer believed to be true. Recent tests show it to be one of the safest manmade sugar substitutes available (far better for you than Splenda or Nutrasweet) and it is VERY CHEAP. I use a little bit, just enough to give the other sweetener a richer flavor. Saccharine has an off flavor that's unpleasant if too much is added, so I only add it as a booster. The other low calorie sweetener I'll sometimes add is all natural lo han (such as Lo Han Sweet, Sweet Sensation Natural Luo Han Guo Syrup, etc.). Lo han has a very unique taste, almost like brown sugar or honey. It's rather pricey so I'll use just a little bit. It greatly enhances the sweetness of other sweeteners. I avoid using splenda and nutrasweet because they are obviously very unhealthy. Splenda gives me stomach pains, and nutrasweet makes me feel drugged (driving on a nutrasweet drugged brain is dangerous), so I avoid those like the plague.<br /><br />Give this product a try. Only you will know if YOU like it or not. It is one of the best stevia based products you can buy. Because it uses only reb A from stevia, it doesn't have the infamous bitter taste of many other stevia products. Similar stevia based products with the same quality include NuStevia and Truvia. Sun Crystals is another new stevia based product that I like. It's stevia mixed with sugar, but the stevia extract is not pure reb A and therefore it has a slight aftertaste like Sweetleaf has, but I like it nonetheless.<br /><br />People who like stevia in general are likely going to love this product. People who've tried bad quality stevia in the past and were put off by the bitterness of a poor quality stevia product should give this product a shot. It's not truly a stevia product, because it only contains reb A, and none of the other sweeteners and compounds found in stevia that impart a bitter aftertaste. Reb A is a very decent sweetener, much better than the other sweeteners found in stevia. Most stevia products contain a mix of all the sweeteners found in stevia, plus other compounds present, which impart a bitter taste. Reb A is an isolated sweetener which doesn't taste the same as a full stevia extract. Much like how sugar doesn't taste like sugar cane or brown sugar. Pure reb A is more expensive than a common stevia extract, and so expect to pay a little more for it. The flavor of reb A is a lot better than a normal stevia extract, it's sort of like thin tasting sugar. Because PureVia contains two other sweeteners, and natural flavors, the taste is far better than reb A is alone. I really have to hand it to the manufacturers. They did a great job.

Summary: Good, Mild Flavor, High Caffeine Coffee
Text:  I consider myself a reasonable coffee enthusiast having done tours of places like Intelligentsia and know a decent bit about how to make the right brew.<br /><br />That said, Lavazza Crema e Gusto is an interesting 30% Arabica, 70% Robusto blend.  It's well known that Robusto beans have less flavor than Arabica and are cheaper, but tend to higher in caffeine content.  That said, that is pretty much what you get with this blend.  It's in all technical aspects a lower quality product, Robusto is considered a low end bean that you will almost never find it in American consumer coffee.  Even instant coffee tends to tout 100% Arabica as well-informed consumers prefer the full flavor.<br /><br />What's interesting is that Lavazza has decided to mix it, and so there's that coffee flavor coming from the Arabica, but it's mild due to how it's diluted.  The "creaminess" I would say comes in part from the very fine grind they use, hence it comes packaged in these vacuum-packed bricks that are more like a mold when you open the bag than the usual medium grind you'll see.  As a result, whether you drip or french press it, you get some of that bean filtrate coming through and it gives it a more creamy texture which is in all actuality the bean particulate coming through.<br /><br />Finally the caffeine kick is awesome, as it's probably 2x stronger than your average coffee thanks to the Robusto beans and the super fine grind, making it a solid wake up coffee.  I personally don't like the taste of it straight as compared to other 100% Arabica coffees like Sumatra or Columbian (which are my preferences) as it's just it's just too bland for my tastes but a touch of milk and sugar brings out more mellow flavors and again that subtle texture.  Good for mornings, but I wouldn't necessarily ever have it as my go to coffee my evening cup.

I've tried both available flavors of Orgain and I find the chocolate to have no remnant of soy protein in its taste.  The shake tastes great at room temp and amazing chilled.  I appreciate that there's some remnants of veggies and fruit in the shake too.<br /><br />Potential downsides:<br />It's not all oil, sugar, and protein....although its mostly that...  So it's not exactly as good as sitting down and eating a sandwich.  The shake is only made in pre-measured little boxes so there's no opportunity to save some money with a tub of a dry mix.  The shakes are expensive too.  The trade off is better ingredients, instead of unpronounceable and artificial junk found in say, Slimfast (although that too is mostly oil, sugar, and protein...just from worse ingredient sources).  The shake is also not vegan if that's something you're looking for.  There's currently only 2 flavors of the shake too, so if variety's your thing, this isn't a good shake to try out long term.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars for the ingredients, the taste, and the fairly extensive nutrition content.  I wish this had more veggies and fruit in it though...vs. 50 mg each of a fruit and veggie blend.

Text:  My whole family loves noodles, due to my daughter being celiac we had to switch to cooking gluten-free. Much to my dismay and my families, gluten-free noodles overall taste like crap! They don"t hold up well, either no matter how long you cook them they are still hard and then mushy, or you cook them right, but when you wanna eat them or mix them with gravy they fall apart. I am a spoiled german, it is said about us that we are extremely picky about food- a brand like "Bionaturae" (suppposedly also from Italy is litterally a insult to my toung feelwise and tastewise. Tinkyada is close, but still comparably FAR away from Le VEneziane. The taste and texture is like real noodles, cook the same too and hold up thje same. My best friend tried the LaVeneziane (which I actually brought from a germany vacation), when I had to spend a week in the hospital with my boy, and she had to take care of my daughter. She called me in the hospital even to tell me how awesome those noodles are and that they taste just like regular noodles. The other day she even asked me if she would make spaghettiesauce, if I could bring those delicious noodles- so we all can have the same as my daughter. That was a first- usually everybody is glad to not have to eat glutenfree, with this it didn't matter any more. The WANTED glutenfree noodles! While in germany we cooked those for my daughter, my dad a trained chef even commented that there is no difference to reall noodles.<br />Try them, in any shape- you will not be dissapointed!<br />PS: Just so you know- in Italy Celiac-desease is a by LAW acknowledged desease (like peanut-allergy)- it has to be declared of everything, schools have to offer glutenfree meals as an alternative- and a standard schoolscreening at the age of 7 IS Celiacs. Italinas have a fine toung too and crappy food would not last.

You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew!

Summary: Hypoglycemic's savior!
Text:  I'm a group exercise instructor who suffers from frequent and severe low blood sugar.  I've been through all sorts of different bars and these are hands down THE BEST.  They taste great, have 6g of dietary fiber and 11g of protein, low in fat....chocolate tastes exactly like a Crunch bar.<br /><br />I noticed a difference in my blood sugar stability the first morning I had one.  I usually can't go without eating something for more than an hour and a half, but these carried me about 3 hours before I realized I needed to eat again.  That says a LOT!  I'm not even going to try the 9 hour claim it makes, but that's just me.<br /><br />LOVE THEM and I'll cry if they ever discontinue them!!

Summary: Ruta Maya wonderful coffee, but don't get fleeced
Text:  We love coffee at our house and by way of our son's trips to Austin, we discovered Ruta Maya.  This is amongst the best, full-flavored, smoothest tasting coffee we have ever had.  We strongly recommend it.  But don't get fleeced by paying as much as Amazon charges.  It is $8.95 per pound at the Ruta Maya website [...] plus shippling and handling.  We recently ordered six bags plus a 12 oz. bag to try their dark roast Cubita coffee and S&H was $11.95.  I am amazed at the Amazon price as we are regular Amazon customers and frequently find its prices lower than most other sources of items.

Summary: Child Friendly Gluten Free Bread!!!!!!!
Text:  We stopped into this cute bakery on a recent trip to San Antonio where it is located.  We bought a loaf of their gluten free white bread for our 8 year old recently diagnosed with Celiacs Disease.  He loves this bread!  When I made him a grilled cheese he said it "tastes just like a real grilled cheese!"  It has a great taste and NO BITTER AFTERTASTE as is commonly the case with other gluten free breads we've tried.  Unfortunately, it is much more expensive(about $2.50 more when buying a single loaf)than the Udi's Gluten Free White Bread we usually buy at our local grocer BUT, in its defense, the loaf is much bigger than an Udi's Gluten Free White Bread loaf (my son calls Udi's toy food sized bread).  A slice of this Little Aussie Bakery White Bread is the closest in size to a regular slice of bread that we have found since he got sick.  I wish we lived in San Antonio because I would love to be able to buy him this bread exclusively but with the expensive price per loaf and expensive shipping ($9.99 for 1 loaf) we just can't afford it:(

Text:  I have relied on these cake mixes for a few years and find them to be handy and to taste fine.  As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make.  The first lemon flavored Sweet `N Low cake I made was adequate but did not have any fresh tart lemon flavor.  The next time I tried using half lemon juice and half water and something very strange happened to the texture, it felt like a sponge.  Not a sponge cake but a dish sponge.  I keep trying to find the right amount of lemon juice to add and have not hit on it yet.  If you do not mind a mild and slightly artificial lemon flavor, than this is a great product.  For first time users I wish that the product description here specified that these mixes make a single thin eight-inch layer.  My local grocery store sells the mixes for $2.79 and rarely has flavors other than chocolate or yellow so the price and variety offered here is wonderful news.

Summary: Best Ghee available
Text:  This ghee is the best available -- the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful, due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass-fed butter during the spring and fall season, when the cows are eating fast-growing green grass. That last part is important -- that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth-building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables -- it can only be gotten from animal fats, organ meats, or some kinds of fermented vegetables.<br /><br />Also, apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive "butter oil" that I used to buy.<br /><br />Finally, I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day. We use it like a supplement.<br /><br />Thank you for a high quality product!

These damn dogs would starve if they didn't get to eat something they liked.  I have been struggling for years to find food that is not made in China, not made from chicken from China even if manufactured in the USA.  Finally, I found Halo.  I integrated the Halo Spots Stew kibble and the Halo Spot's Stew chicken canned into the Paps diet over 2 weeks.  Week one they ate half of the Halo and by the end of week two they were eating ALL of the Halo product and the small amount of the old brand was left in their bowls.  Their skin is fantastic, their poops are a perfect consistency (not too hard or too soft) and they are energetic and just happy and excited for meal time now.  I also feed them the Halo LiL Bits freeze dried chicken treats.  All of the ingredients are from USA and made solely here.  And, I am thrilled that my favorite TV talk show host, Ms. Ellen Degeneres is a part owner of the company.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering this here as it is hard to get in my somewhat small town pet stores who seem to cater to gross China food that will make all our dogs sick.

I'm a condiment queen and it was really hard for me to give up a lot of my condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo).  I was never a salt user - I'm a self-described fresh pepper addict and connoisseur.  However, once I realized this salt was raw, all natural and got great reviews, I decided to try it.  This really does enhance almost every dish I eat.  In addition, there are a ton of articles online explaining why this 200 million year old natural nutrient is so very good for us.  Move over table salt with your history of ridicule and side effects; move in Himalayan salt.

It's been about 2 months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas, she has less dandruff and I've noticed a lot less scratching from her in general.

Summary: Love It!  Plus A Little "Science"
Text:  I will not repeat the many positive reviews of this appliance.  I love it for the same reasons everybody else who loves it does:  one small appliance, no pots and pans, a few pieces into the dishwasher, no timing, no recipes, easy peasy.  I actually like that it makes a small amount of food.  If something is rejected, I don't have a gallon ziplock of useless food cubes taking up room in the freezer.  I'd rather have variety than bulk.  Plus, it's super easy to incorporate leftover meat or fish or rice with your fresh veggies and reheat/cook and puree together.<br /><br />I wanted to share, though, a little bit of research I did to make it even easier to use.  I like to make a couple of batches in a row so I can do combinations or single-veg purees with the same small group of ingredients.  What do you do when your already-peeled potatoes don't all fit?  Mix them with some zucchini or cauliflower and do a second mixed batch!  There are two logistical problems with this:  there is no information on the steamer basket's capacity so you can't chop the second or third batch in advance, and the "measures" of water are also not defined.  Since the mixing bowl is also the water measuring bowl, you would have to wash it out really carefully between uses to avoid getting food particles in the reservoir.  Other than protecting the cleanliness of the reservoir, it does not seem necessary to do more than a quick rinse if you're doing two vegetables in a row.  So I did a little "science" and found:  "one measure" of water is about 1/4 cup, 2 measures 1/2 cup, 3 measures 3/4 cup.  Also, the description says that the bowl has a 2.5 cup capacity.  Not so.  It is the *steamer basket* that has a 2.5 cup capacity.

Text:  I too am probably going to be giving away several jars of this paste - a very small amount goes a long way, and I'm not sure how long its shelf life is.  There are spaces on the label for batch number, manufacturing date, and expiration date - but just one number (91016) stamped in that general area - appears to be a batch number.<br /><br />While the lack of an expiration date is annoying, I'm otherwise very happy with this - makes pad thai taste like pad thai, so long as you don't overdo it.  I had never used it before and was working with a recipe calling for processing your own tamarind pulp, so I tried guessing at the right amount.  Next time I'll remember to read the bottle - "one teaspoon for six persons...."  Am just beginning to experiment with other uses.  The manufacturer's web site suggests using it to flavor stews and as a replacement for mango pulp or for vinegar in recipes, and yes, there are lots of recipes out there that call for it.

Summary: I love it!
Text:  I really debated whether or not I needed a baby food maker.  This is baby #4 and don't know that we'll have another & it seemed like a lot of money if I only use it for one baby for a few months.  BUT the manual grinders suck!  And a blender is too big for a small job & my electric mini chopper just doesn't do the job (and it's also a little big).  AND the Baby Brezza had a great product video vs. the much cheaper KidCo one.  I couldn't even find a YouTube for that one!  And I'm a total sucker for advertising.  Marketers dream of people like me.  Anyway-<br /><br />I'm so glad that I spent the money on the Baby Brezza!  My primary reason for buying a baby food maker was so that I could process our own dinner (when it's healthy enough) & feed it to my baby.  The Baby Brezza definitely delivers!  The first time I used it I was processing some soup with chicken in it.  There were a few small chicken chunks left in the rest of the puree.  So the next time I processed a meal with chicken, I cut the chicken into smaller dices & I added a little more water to the Baby Brezza & also blended it longer.  That did the trick.  It was so easy to use that I decided to try a banana.  Fork mashing the banana kept it too thick for my picky baby, but in the Brezza she was happy with the texture.  Then I got an avocado.  And then a mango.  And zucchini.  Things that I'd never even considered feeding my babies at this age because you can't buy baby food avocado (although I realize you can get mango blends).<br /><br />My picky baby would have nothing to do with store bought baby food vegetables, unless I bought the expensive organic (and more creative) blends in the pouches.  But with the Baby Brezza she's happy to have freshly pureed veggies!  And this is how easy it is to use: I dice up a few carrots (as I am chopping some up for our own dinner prep), put them in the Brezza cup, look at their little included cookbook for the amt of time to steam carrots, hit the Steam + Blend button, and leave it alone while I work more on the rest of the family's dinner.  After the carrots are finished steaming the Brezza purees them without me having to do a thing & it beeps when it's finished.  How cool is that?!  Sometimes there are still a couple/few tiny chunks of whatever I've pureed.  Big deal - I'd be surprised if anything made for a home kitchen would be any different.  Oh, as a side note the included "cook book" was a let down.  The Baeba one seemed better, but not $50 better!<br /><br />So I was a little worried that my husband would give me a hard time when I told him how much the Baby Brezza cost, but as I made my first blend he joked about how it was already saving us one dollar.  He'll ask me at the end of the day if I've made any baby food & when I tell him what I've blended he'll say "that's --more dollars saved!"  The Baby Brezza will eventually pay for itself.<br /><br />One more thing to note is that I am not in any way a person who has been concerned about making my own baby food in the past.  I see nothing wrong with store bought baby food.  BUT it's awesome to know that my baby is getting fresh, nutrient-rich food when I make it myself.  Also as I was feeding my baby some baby food from a jar I noticed it had that gross metallic smell (like when you open a can of Spaghetti-O's!), and guess what?- it tasted like that too!  Yuck!  So of course you won't get that when you make it yourself.  I find myself thinking of what I can blend up next for my baby.  I even ordered a baby food book just so I could have good combo ideas.  I seriously haven't had this much fun with an appliance since I got my KitchenAid at the beginning of my marriage 10 years ago!<br /><br />Buy the Baby Brezza - you'll love it!

Summary: Not at all what I expected
Text:  I ordered this product thinking it would be similar to the rock sugar I was using all over Germany this past winter.  They also sell it at Teavana but at an extremely high price compared to what I brought back from Germany (obviously there is a big expense on bringing sugar to the US).  I was excited to find these online and the picture looked like what I had brough back from Germany.  I'm not sure it was the same thing.  The crystals weren't the same color as the German rock sugar, it was cloudy in color and was more like pebbles vs. rocks.  The order took an entire 2 or 3 weeks to actually process and ship, come to find out, the place it shipped from was in my state.  I thought it was completely ridiculous how long it took and when it arrived it was poorly packaged.  It came in a white box (similar to a shirt box but a bit smaller) and the rocks were all falling out of it and pressed up against the box (between the it and the worn and dirty looking plastic wrapping that enclosed the box).  When I opened the plastic liner, the box was so flimpsy the sugar was going all over my counter despite how careful I was seeing how damaged the box was.  Never again.

Summary: Good, but pricey.
Text:  Pros: My dogs love them. They last a long time. They don't really stink after the first 30 seconds.<br /><br />Cons: They're a little pricey.  And I don't like to think about what they're made out of.  They lose the star on price, though.  Pound for pound, they cost more than dry-aged USDA Prime Rib.  I don't buy USDA Dry-Aged Prime Rib for myself, so I'm not sure how I got talked into paying that kind of money for a dog treat.  I blame my wife.  She says I'm stingy with the dogs.  I say I'm pragmatic and our dogs would be happy eating out of the litterbox if we would let them.<br /><br />My dogs will recite Shakespearean sonnets for these treats.  One of them has learned how to mow the lawn for me, and the other has started grading my students' homework in exchange for a half-length of one of these apparently delectable sections of dried out taurine...parts.  (Seriously, don't look up what they're made out of if you're squeamish.)<br /><br />These things are expensive compared to regular rawhide, but they do provide a longer chewtime-per-inch for my mutts and, so I've been told by professionals, don't have the same potential to cause gastrointestinal damage.  Furthermore, I cannot emphasize enough how much my dogs prefer these things to regular rawhide chews.  They just have to see me move my hand toward the bag and all of a sudden my two Tasmanian devils are stone-still statues of obedience eagerly awaiting, nay, eagerly DESIRING any word of command I might give.  Therefore, despite the price, I don't feel I've gotten the shaft on this deal.  At least not metaphorically.  Euphemistically, though, I suppose I got a whole bag of them.<br /><br />Oops, sorry.  Now you know what they're made out of.<br /><br />When you first open the bag, they'll smell bad.  After 30 seconds, there is no scent whatsoever unless you wave one of them right under your nose.  If you're the kind of person who regularly waves dried out steer phallus under your nose and you need them to be totally odor-free, get a different product.<br /><br />You'll need some heavy-duty garden shears or a really sharp cleaver if you're going to cut the foot-longs down to smaller sizes.  This process makes me wince in some sort of primal, Y-chromosome encoded empathic reaction, even though I realize the animal from which the product was taken no longer has need of it.  My wife says I'm a wuss.  I say I'm compassionate.<br /><br />If you have neither a prohibitively strong gender-based moral qualm regarding the raw materials used to make a bully stick nor a hyper-developed sense of smell, and you can afford to pay Dry-aged USDA Prime Rib prices to throw pieces of dessicated steer pizzle to an animal that will wolf down filet mignon with the same delight it takes in bolting cat poop when you're not watching, then go ahead and buy these.  At least your dogs will give you their undivided attention for the 15 seconds between your opening the bag and distributing the treat.

The knob turns quite a bit so it's not just a two stage choice but allows for a range. Be careful though as I left the bottle too close to the stove one day and the top melted. The grinder cap came off and could not be reattached. I dumped the salt into a container and I use it whenever I need a pinch. The salt is very coarse obviously but works fine for cooking.<br /><br />Overall I like these grinders as they are nice and big and the adjustable grind is a nice touch. Shop around though because Amazon does not have the best price on these and I was able to pick them up for about half this price locally.

Summary: Great for new Celiacs!
Text:  I love this protein powder. I am intolerant to gluten, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, and soy. Intolerance to dairy is very common with newly diagnosed Celiacs or gluten intolerance. My intolerance really restricts my options for added protein other than meat. It is gentle on the digestive system and is great in smoothies! I put it in a smoothie with two cups of frozen fruit, a cup of coconut milk (or more depending on how liquid you want...) and a tablespoon of local honey to help with my allergies so I don't have to take allergy medications (plus tastes yummy). Hemp is truly a super food. Aloe juice in the smoothie instead of milk and a tablespoon of coconut oil gives great health benefits. I don't know how great this would be just mixed with milk like you do muscle milk and other whey proteins; it is definitely brownish green and a little gritty being it is plant material ground fine. Amazon is the cheapest place for it by far and shipping was right on schedule, a day early even. I am satisfied and will be using this product for years (Fun Fact: it take an average of 1 1/2 to 2 years for the small intestine to heal enough from severe gluten damage to properly absorb dairy).

They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

As an extra, they taste good and are easy to suck down, After a little research I found that honey is pre-digested by bees, so I guess that's why it works better for me.

Summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
Text:  This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

Summary: Genuine Ras El Hanout
Text:  'Ras El Hanout' means 'top of the shop', indicating a blend of many spices (in some instances, more than 100) as favoured by whatever spice merchant happens to be selling it to you.  Thus, it varies greatly in composition from one merchant to another.  Some are more 'traditional' blends than others, and some are just lazy Westernised versions about as exotic as K-Mart Curry Powder.<br /><br />This is not a 'lazy' Ras El Hanout.<br /><br />Coming in at a reasonable 35 spices (including Rose Powder, Lavender Powder, Grains Of Paradise, and 32 others), this lovely blend strikes just the right balance of spicy, sweet, floral, and savoury.  I use it with Couscous, Hummus, Tabouli, Kebabs, Chicken Bastila - really anything North African or Middle Eastern.  Hell, I'll even dust some Naan lightly with it prior to heating in my oven; I'm not some xenophobic Food Purist!<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it...

They taste every bit as good as chocolate chips that do contain dairy (and in my opinion even better) plus they can be enjoyed by people who cannot have dairy or gluten.  They were also picked as a best chocolate chip by America's Test Kitchen.  After going up against seven other brands (including many popular and premium brands) they were the winner, which reinforces their quality for me.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Evaporated cane juice, unsweetened chocolate cocoa butter, roasted soy flour, soy lecithin (an emulsifier), pure vanilla extract.<br /><br />Overall, these are awesome chocolate chips.  If I had done a blind taste test I would have never known that they were vegan.  They are a litle more expensive than conventional brands, but still in line with premium brands which given they are delicious as well as dairy and gluten free, is worth it for me.

Summary: I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed
Text:  After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

Summary: A good way to prepare and store your SACO milk
Text:  I decided to switch from grocery store milk to SACO's powder for mathematical reasons. As a single lady who uses milk primarily for my tea, I rarely finish a one-gallon bottle before it sours (hate that race to use it all!), and buying half gallon containers absolutely bugs me, as it costs five bucks for two (purchased one at a time) instead of three skins for a single gallon. Plus, there's the inconvenience of schlepping to the store every few days for another half-gallon. I'm a "stock up and go shopping as infrequently as possible" type.<br /><br />Here's my solution for mixing and storing SACO milk.<br /><br />1.) Buy two plastic half gallons of store milk and rinse the bottles out thoroughly when they're empty.<br /><br />2.) Mix up a quart of SACO in a large Pyrex (glass) handled measuring cup and use its convenient spout to pour the milk into an empty grocery bottle. Repeat the process. (Note: having the Pyrex device clearly marked off in red sure makes measuring the powder easy. Just start with 8 oz. of SACO, then add water to the quart line.)<br /><br />3.) Put the cap on the filled bottle and vigorously shake this half-gallon to assure all the SACO has dissolved. Refrigerate. (A bottom shelf is best, as it's colder.)<br /><br />4.) When you get down near to the last of that bottle, mix up a second one and refrigerate it. This way, you'll always have a supply of milk on hand. Rinse out the first container when it's empty and leave the cap off. Give it a quick rinse just before re-using.<br /><br />I chose grocery bottles for storage as it satisfies a life-long habit of pouring milk from one. Since I'm no longer buying one gallon jugs, lifting and pouring from these smaller bottles is much less of a strain, and I have YET to throw away any milk mixed from powder because the half-gallon spoiled before I could finish it all.<br /><br />If you've never before experimented with instant non-fat milk but are thinking along the lines of this review's first paragraph, give SACO a shot. Those two half-gallon bottles I suggested just may be the last milk you'll ever lug home from the market.

Text:  I've come to trust the Stash brand, among only a few others due to its consistently excellent product line and variety.  I was initially a fan of English Breakfast tea, but was introduced to Irish Breakfast tea some time back.  A slightly thicker liquor produced than does English Breakfast, it mixes well with a variety of items (sugar and milk are recommended, but certain alcoholic bases or mixers sit quite nicely if you want to switch up the classic Hot Toddy concept or use Kahlua instead of sugar), and has an even stronger aroma and flavor than your regular black tea.<br /><br />If you're a fan of weaker brews where one or two dunks is good enough, this is not for you.  I tend to steep this for a long while (tea experts would call me nuts for doing this as it could scald and alter the flavor of the leaves), but I love the strength of the brew afterwards.  This is great to have on-the-go, too, and hearty to drink if you're ill and require a lot of liquids.

My grandmother used to use vinegar to clean fruits and it works great, but it has a strong smell and often that smell can stick to the surface of the fruit.  Fit has no unpleasant scent and it does a great job.  You can see how much more dirt comes off than when just using water.  Plus it's kosher which is a plus for the times when I have my 2 modern orthodox jewish friends and their kids over.<br /><br />One reviewer says the plastic bowl has BPA.

Text:  Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-six generous bars of delectable dark chocolate with an orange flavored marzipan. The combination of great chocolate, almonds, and citrus is truly terrific. Have a quality piece of chocolate and actually eat less 'cause it is so satisfying.  Gave these bars as little gifts. Stick it in your backpack for an energy treat while out hiking.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!

Summary: Good Bagged Pu-erh
Text:  Is this cheap, "Heck, no."<br /><br />Is this good, "Yes!"<br /><br />Pu-erhs (ooo-air)are made into little (or big) cakes of tea, and then allowed to ferment (rot).  Bad Pu-erh tastes like tea left to rot.  This definitely does not.  It has a warm oak flavor.<br /><br />Pu-erhs are "double-fermented".  Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea, and then form the leaves into cakes.  Pu-erhs take awhile to ferment; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years.  Because of the longer processing time, pu-erhs are generally more expensive, so this isn't a bad price for pu-erh, although it is a little pricey for tea.<br /><br />This is good pu-erh for other reasons:  unless you have a tea diffuser, you can't make pu-erh teas--they're not generally sold in bags.  If you're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement, e.g., an American, these bags are a real find.<br /><br />Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot--or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup.

Summary: Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute
Text:  One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.

Mine recommended giving my baby 2oz of prune juice 2x a day. (And he was a Preemie) It does bubble up a LOT if you shake it up when mixing. Use a spoon instead, or add 2-3 drops of gas drops into the bottle. (Wal-Mart sells the generic form of Mylicon for around $4 and you get double the amount, instead of $12)<br /><br /> I have had another child since I first found this formula and I would use nothing else!

It has caffeine, for those of us that need our tea to provide a boost in our energy levels.  It is also a relatively mild (or weak, if you prefer) tea, which is the way I prefer my tea (this might be a negative for those that prefer a stronger cup of tea).<br /><br />While being 100% Natural is a good thing, I have to balance that against my budget, and this tea, while having a great flavor, simply doesn't provide sufficient value to me to justify the price.  There are a lot of other tea options out there, and it is really hard for me to pass over other, more affordable, options for this.  For people with different budget priorities, this may well be worth it.

Not that I have anything against good ol' Hersheys but my palate has grown up a bit over the years and I happen to LOVE the less sweet, more natural taste of this spread.<br /><br />To me, this tastes more like milk chocolate than dark which the description says it is made with; makes sense as it does contain milk too. You definitely taste the fresh toasted hazelnuts as well. The texture is great for dipping that banana in the two tiny teaspoons the label says I can have. Somehow with the perfect balance of chocolate and hazelnut just that little bit does seem to satisfy my cravings though.

Text:  I've been trying to make beef Pho at home for several months now with zero success. I finally did some extra searching when looking for some type of Pho base and found this. I read the reviews and ordered instantly.<br />It's so good. It's as good as our local restaurant. I followed some advice such as using less base so I made a gallon and used 4oz (5oz or half jar is what it calls for) or base and one spice packet. I let the spice packet boil for about an hour. I tasted it after the first boil as the instructions say but it didn't have as much flavor as I like.<br />My whole family loved it.<br />The only thing is I used rice stick noodles that weren't very good. I've tried thin rice noodles but those were about the same as the sticks. My local restaurant uses rice noodles that are very soft and look close to an angel hair pasta size. Maybe I'm not cooking the rice noodles long enough because they didn't get as soft as I like.

They wash the laundry in the bag and both have ripped after only 2 uses.  I gave them a 3 b/c they are not that bad..just not what I was needing.  The seller was awesome!  I received the bags here in Afghanistan after only 6 days from the original order date so I have to say the seller was very expedient.

When we first found this in our grocery store, we were exstatic to find it and hoped it would still taste good.  Well, it certainly does and ordering on Amazon with Prime makes it a no brainer in the cost department.  We can add 1-2 packs of this to a GIANT pan of chicken and tons of veggies to make a nice light stir fry.  Mixed with lots of vegetables in the dish, the calories can be maintained to stay low enough to have a big portion.  1 package covers a lot of food and it has a strong flavor so do not use too much if your dish is on the smaller side.

I'm sure I will drink up the whole 100 packs in one month or less.<br /><br />This tea can be steeped in room temperature water.  That's right.  No need to heat up any water.  Just steep it for 3 minutes in room temperature water. GREAT FOR CAMPING AND ON THE RUN.<br /><br />I've never liked green tea either because it is so bitter.<br /><br />This tea has no bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I bought mine at Costco 2 days ago and was going to force myself to drink it for all the health benefits including antioxidants and to speed up my metabolism. Green tea takes an inch off my waste after just one cup. Apparently, with age we get bloated. But I won't need to force myself to drink it because it has no bitter taste to it at all.  It is so pleasant drinking it.<br /><br />It didn't keep me awake all night like other green teas do.<br /><br />In the winter, I will use lightly warmed water instead of room temperature.<br /><br />If you want hot tea just heat up the water (NO BOILING WATER ALLOWED) and steep for 3 minutes.<br /><br />Remember, you can use any temperature water with this tea.<br /><br />The instructions say that using cold water releases less of the caffeine.  I don't like caffeine so using unheated water is perfect for me.

You basically put different amounts of water for whatever noodle you're eating and it tastes amazing each time. For instance, udon uses 1 part memmi, 12 parts water. It's extremely simple and tastes soooo good. Me and my daughter always drink the soup after and I make extra now so that we can have a lot of soup to drink with each noodle!

Summary: Glad we tried, has made a difference
Text:  My family rescued a pug mix from a shelter a couple months ago.  We used the puppy food they gave us and then matched the brand at our local store later.  A couple months went by, wouldn't say our dog didn't like her cheap dog food, but she did develop demodex and a whole new world about dogs and health opened up to us.  Bottom line, we were feeding her, but our vet compared it to us eating spaghettios every day for every meal for life.<br /><br />Demodex is not contagious but inherited and a skin disorder we had to treat.  We talked to our vet about her immune system and how we would want to keep her as healthy as possible during treatment and after.  While he didn't really recommend any particular brand, he did encourage us to educate ourselves about what's out there.<br /><br />After some research and with the idea that we buy Newman's Own brand foods for our human selves, we ordered the dry kibble and mixed it with the active dog and puppy formula canned food they make as well.  Our dog does love this food, and clearly prefers the canned to the her old cheap foil top square packages we'd pick up each grocery visit.  We have noticed that her fur, while always been soft, has become thick and buttery soft when you pet her.<br /><br />I know the vet warned us that the treatment might have adverse effects, but she has been fine.  I credit a healthier diet for getting her through this.  And it clearly has done wonders for her skin and coat.  Added bonus, the food actually smells good with minimal odor as opposed to the cheapy stuff which made me gaggy.

Summary: Brownie mixes are NOT all alike
Text:  Truly homemade brownies are great, of course, but there are times (more than I care to admit) when I suddenly have a craving for some chocolate, & the brownie form thereof is preferred, but I simply don't care to take the time & engage in the effort associated with 'from scratch' (besides, I don't always have the chocolate [let alone various other] ingredients for such on hand [& to an extent, that's intentional]).<br /><br />So, what 'feeding a brownie craving' usually comes down to, for me, is to grab a box of this terrific brownie mix (& no other, at this point [it's simply that good]), throw in the specified egg, vegetable oil, & water, & then after stirring, I pour it into what I now think of as a 'magic', insulated, small, (& non-stick) square metal pan (& for what it's worth, I do notice a definite 'optimized' outcome when baking this in an insulated pan), & then partake of the delicious goodness approximately 40 minutes later (I bake it for 33 minutes [extra time due to the type of pan], turn off the oven & let them stay in for another 2 minutes, & then after approximately 5 minutes outside of the oven, I take a silicone spatula to it, & 'begin extracting' ;) [an interesting 'benefit' to marking the pieces with a somewhat firm & relatively slim silicone spatula, is that it 'wraps' the top 'edges' slightly, so there are no crumb-like anythings which get separated from the piece, & to boot, the top edges of the pieces end up looking more 'neat' (though don't get me wrong, I also love the more 'crisp-ish'-along-the-top -type 'edge' often found with homemade brownies, & that often have a kind of looks-like-the-top-of-a-pie-crust -type top layer)]).<br /><br />For my first taste, I don't wait for these to completely cool (nowhere near), & despite my removing the first piece only ~5 minutes post-oven, the piece stays together (enough for 'transport', & with 'help'/support from the silicone spatula) (& vs. being a kind of semi-solid that breaks up like crazy wherever pressure occurred during 'lift-off'), & the cohesion isn't stiff, & it's not lava-like -- it's got that recognizable moist aspect that gives it a ~cake-like appeal (though it ends up having a 'thicker' texture than a cake would [these are brownies, afterall]).<br /><br />Honestly, I marvel at both the taste & texture of the brownies made from this mix -- they're terrific, & I'd prefer these brownies to most others, without a doubt (& yes, I'm also including 'from scratch' homemade, when I say that) -- the outcome produced in conjunction with this mix is close to the perfect balance for me of the major 'factors' associated with the 'brownie experience' -- namely, a wonderful & chocolatey-fudge taste, a moist & 'just right' chewy texture, & importantly, the repeatability of my being able to 'reproduce' the result over & over, each time I utilize the mix.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot overstate the importance of that insulated metal pan to the delectably optimized outcome I've experienced with this mix -- I've baked this with a glass pan, & with a standard metal pan, as well, & although the brownies tasted very good, the result from those wasn't as 'even' as that found with an insulated metal pan, & they were definitely not as moist (though their extra chewiness was also welcome, & if I let the insulated pan -made brownies cool long enough, they also have a chewiness that differs from the hot-off-the-presses outcome I am at times partial to, & seem to simply 'go for' when in the throes of a brownie craving [part of the reason for which is that this more cake-like brownie experience (in cutting a few pieces while still quite warm [though not steaming hot] ends up making for a great base beneath the all natural canned-in-a-jar cherry pie mix topping that has become a yummy addition for any while-still-quite-warm brownie slices I decide to enjoy 'first' [& when I have any of the brownie slices in their otherwise preferred 'au natural' form, they taste terrific whether still warm, or whether cooled & at room temp, & whether same day or next]).<br /><br />The manufacturer of this product has kept the 'customer contribution to the mix composition' aspect to a minimum, but not at the expense of the mix subsequently having a bunch of artificial whatnot in the place of would-be-used-with-a-scratch-recipe ingredients (although, to be clear, the cocoa powder used in the mix does get 'fancied up' a tad, what with the manufacturer also including some powdered sugar in the mix [& I mention this only to point out that although it isn't 'artificial', it isn't always included by folks in a to-make-from-scratch brownie recipe (regardless, if it's part of the ingredient 'choir' of this mix, & knowing what I do about the outcome, I appreciate its 'voice')]).<br /><br />The picture associated with this listing of the product doesn't happen to show what is printed on the very top (you can see a hint of such, though it's hard to read in the existing image), but what it says is, "Premium Brownie Mix" & then beneath that, "No Preservatives".<br /><br />The brownies I make from this mix -- & which I bake (& exclusively, at this point) in an insulated metal pan (I truly cannot overstate the importance of this aspect, or the amazing difference that this pan makes) do not end up in any way reminding me of what I have come to think of as a 'made from a box' taste (or 'look') otherwise typically encountered with off-a-shelf boxed mixes.  The magic produced by pairing this mix, & the minimal additional ingredients called for, with an insulated metal pan, results in something that many might think was homemade, but regardless, many would find to be delicious.<br /><br />With all due respect to -- and in addition to how much I love -- the wonderful homemade brownies made by my grandmother, & by my mother, I hereby profess food-love for the brownies I can make with this mix...

Text:  If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or "too strong" ending. I enjoy drinking my coffee black without the additives to cover up taste that just isn't that good. I find this is so good tasting that there is no need to add anything. I do not enjoy Starbucks because to get the flavor you also have to take the bitter and too strong with it. I want a full rich flavor without thinking I am drinking bitter espresso. I would recommend trying this Brazilian favorite and see what you are missing. A mere 6 level tablespoons makes a full 12 cup pot in my Cuisinart maker, so this ends up being quite reasonable in cost as well. 5 Star in my book.

It took me about a week to get the impressive results.  I have very dry skin. My serums and creams were not penetrating into my skin to give me a hydrated look.  Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.  I also use the eye treatment, spray toner (use throughout the day to freshen up makeup), body polish and body creams. Sometimes I can get lucky and find this product line in stores; but not very often.  Finally a product line that works!

I just drained the oil from the can and mixed it with the ingredients.<br />I intend to use this with a green salad mix or even pasta.<br /><br />Although I do like salt, next time I may try rinsing the tuna in a colander but not pressing it. With some of the shredded stuff you may just end up with a spoon-full.<br />For quick meals, I used to like Hot-Dogs but not any more. The taste of this yellow-fin tuna is quite good, actually much better than I had expected. Some of the tuna you get from the local grocery store may look like cat food when you open it up. This definitely does not.<br />I will buy it again because you can't beat the Amazon price with Free Shipping.

Text:  I eat oats with some regularity (pun intended).  The rolled oats are fine when I'm in a hurry.  When there is time, steel cut is the way to go.  These McCann's oats are pretty good.  When I have a lot of time, I use Alton Brown's overnight oatmeal recipe as a starting point.  My recipe is basically a cup of oats, 3 cups water, a 1 cup milk, and a cup or two of dried fruity stuff if any is handy.  It goes into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4FTZU">crock pot</a> and cooks overnight.  I cook mine on medium.<br /><br />Next time I order oats I'm going to try out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007NG56S">Steel Cut Oats Pinhead Oatmeal - Bulk 50 Pound Bag</a>.

Summary: Best grape soda ever! --but not worth buying online :(

SO DELISH!!!<br /><br />As much as I love this soda, I wouldn't fork out the money to buy this online... it's ridiculous at $3.52/bottle.<br />The marble version, while "neat" loses its novelty fairly quickly. cost-wise, the marble version, isn't worth a repeat buy and you're better off just buying the 500ml can or the 12oz can,  especially if you're really thirsty. (also, for some reason, the can/bottles ones seem to taste better than the marble ones o_O<br /><br />if you're lucky enough to be near the seramonte dai so, they have the 500ml tin bottles for $1.50/$1 and the one in downtown san francisco one has the 12oz cans for 2/$1.50<br />i'd wait. or go to an asian market that sells the marble versions to find the soda and try to see if they don't have the can bottle/versions.<br /><br />but, if you got money to burn, or you're crazy the soda thAT badly, go for it!

Summary: A little different in a good way - the pepper makes it tasty! Savory-sweet. Very filling.
Text:  I bought a bag of these 15 oz. Sahale Snacks (Pomegranate Pistachios with Almonds, Cherries and Black Pepper) at Costco for $10.89. I was curious about the black pepper listed as an ingredient.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the taste, especially the savory aspect heightened by black pepper and sea salt. There is a hint of spice...the manufacturers call it "inspired by" their favorite Moroccan flavors. Overall, the mix is a bit sweeter than I like (7g of sugars in 1 serving, which is about 1/4 cup).<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />pistachios, almonds, dried apples (unsulfured apples, sugar, natural pomegranate flavor, citric acid, fruit and vegetable juice [for color]), organic evaporated cane juice, dried cherries (cherries, sugar, sunflower oil), organic tapioca syrup, brown sugar, sea salt, pomegranate juice concentrate, dried lemon peel, spices, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor.<br /><br />This mix is probably a lot healthier than a bag of potato chips, but as I'm trying to cut down on my sugar intake, I'll eat them sparingly. A handful is very filling, so I don't end up eating the whole bag in one sitting. The bag is conveniently self-sealing.

Summary: Blocked Bladder
Text:  I switched to this food from Innova. I have a male and a female cat. They've been eating it for about a year. They're 2 years old. The pet store we were buying Innova from started replacing Innova with Innova EVO, and my cats would eat it-- but they were breaking out on their chin from it. They offered other things, but I ended up using this. It was a special order, but I'd sampled the bag and the cat acne disappeared.<br /><br />This past month, my male cat started peeing on the floor. We thought it was due to the stress of moving and our new baby and ignored it. Then he started to meow a ton. We thought he wanted more attention. He was still playing with our other cat. We ignored it. Then he started shaking while trying to walk to the litter box. We took him to the vet at 4a. He had a blocked bladder. Per our vet, he'd been hearing this a lot from male cats who are eating Wellness core. Honestly, I think the only reason he didn't have symptoms sooner is that I was giving him Innova EVO wet food for awhile in addition to the dry food. The other cat didn't eat it, so I didn't want to get food that both of them couldn't enjoy.<br /><br />Fixing a blocked bladder is VERY expensive. Also, there is no guarantee that your cat will be completely unblocked after treatment. Thus far, our guy is doing well. We still crate him to make sure he's peeing, eating, and drinking. It's hard to monitor this with two cats otherwise.<br /><br />Our male cat is now on a Prescription diet from the vet recommended brand that I'm not too fond of... He seems okay. We've switched our other cat onto the same diet.<br /><br />I will never purchase Wellness CORE again.

Summary: LOTTA chocolate here!
Text:  I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.<br /><br />Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.<br /><br />And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options.

Summary: Superbly Refreshing
Text:  I drink water from my jug as I work through long days, and I love water so much, I usually drink more from a glass when I get home as well. Water is my drink of choice.<br /><br />This Essentia pH balanced water has an advantage over plain water when it comes to refreshment. I've read about the scientifically most agreeable level of pH in water before, but I had never tried any of it until now.<br /><br />Having had jugged tap water until I was blue in the face that hot workday, I figured there would be no better time to try my Essentia once I got home and I was all watered-out. In every bit of honesty, I savored this bottle of water. I chugged, at a reasonable pace, every drop. I found it delicious, smooth and refreshing.<br /><br />Sure, it's more than just water; actually, it's purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride. That's what it takes to achieve the perfect pH that makes it so easy to glide through all six servings these 1.5 liter bottles provide. Like most commercial beverages, this one has a formula as well, and it works out great.<br /><br />In the end, it's still water, but there is something favorable about water with a pH of 9.5. When chilled, this stuff is remarkably enjoyable. If you're a water connoisseur and you buy bottled water anyway, then definitely try Essentia - it's very nice.

Summary: Small Jars and a Little Runny - like most commercial baby foods
Text:  Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much "fuller", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!

Text:  I've seen some reviewers commenting on the sugar and sodium content of Roland Sriracha.  If you go to the Roland website, [...] or look on the actual bottle you'll see the sodium content is only 125mg per serving and sugar is 1gram per serving...about the same as Huy Fong.  It is NOT 2500mg of sodium and 18 grams of sugar per serving (which is 1 teaspoon) as suggested by a few reviewers and one obviously incorrect website.  Even a teaspoon of pure table sugar only contains 4 grams of sugar!  Check your facts before posting.<br /><br />Anyway, this sauce is okay.  It's been growing on me as I get through the bottle.  Still not as good as Huy Fong which is tangier and doesn't have such a garlic taste to it.

Summary: Not 1-WW Point!
Text:  I ordered this item because the 1-point WW popcorn is hard to find in the stores; and when i received it last night, it was the 3-point WW popcorn.  I was sent the wrong item; but the popcorn is delicious.

Summary: GREAT FOR COLD SALADS.
Text:  Cold pasta dishes need this splash of extra color and nutrients.<br />  I undercook the pasta a bit, cool it in the fridge, add a can of chilled tomatoes in sauce (the noodles absorb the extra liquid), a bit of mayo (but not much, as adding canned tomatoe), some onion, celery, real bacon bits and re-chill it...VOILA.<br /> If you don't have celery on hand it still tastes great, even with dehydrated onions it taste fine.  I may add grated cheese, chicken or tuna.

Summary: Good Kona coffee blend
Text:  We really like Tully's Kona Blend in the K-Cups!  It's hard to find inexpensive 100% Kona coffee anywhere, so I usually order the K-Cup blends that are available either on Amazon, or at our local commissary, because I really love the unique flavor and aroma of Kona.<br /><br />I think that Tully's is a quality brand of coffee in general, but the Kona is my favorite.  It's delicious: rich, smooth, nutty, the flavor and aroma make a great start to my day.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!

Summary: Looking for Adequate... Found Fantastic
Text:  I've been looking for a sausage that was as good as the Penrose ones that are no longer available... these are fantastic!!!  More meaty, not as mealy, with a much better "snappy" texture.  A little hotter than the Penrose, but by far the best I've had.  I wish the shipping was cheaper, but will definitely purchase again once these 2 jars are gone.

Summary: Weak. Very weak.
Text:  Didn't care for it. Color is wrong, doesn't have the flavor. Tastes almost as if it were watered down, or, maybe, birch beer lite. Gonna have to try a different brand. I had pretty high hopes, too, as Pa. is the state where I first was exposed to birch beer. Can't recommend this brand. On the off chance that someone reads my reviews, I will sing loud praises when I find one to my taste.

Summary: Great for IBD cats
Text:  My cat has allergies to chicken and pork, which are in most mainstream cat foods but this limited ingredient formula is working well for her so far. She used to get a steroid every day to help her tolerate her old food--with this stuff we've got the dose pushed out to once every three days and I'm hoping we'll be able to discontinue the meds altogether (per advice of my vet, of course). We were on rabbit-based food for a while but switched to canned for urinary health and this venison variety is pretty easy to find.<br /><br />You do need to adjust the feeding guidelines to match your cat/your vet's recommendations though. My 12 lb kitty seems content with half a can twice a day, which is the recommended amount for 8 lb cats--in fact, I may need to cut her back a little. I'm sure it makes a difference as to whether they're inside or out. My guys are in and just don't seem to need as much food to maintain weight.

Summary: Warning: May Be Addictive
Text:  My dog absolutely loves these treats. We have tried many treats since we have had her, and she has never loved any of them as much as she loves these. When she is done eating one, she will stalk the bag and try to manipulate us into giving her another one. She literally goes crazy for them. I like the fact there are so few ingredients and that they do not have any grains in them. Our dog is getting older, so I feel good about the ingredients for her joints. The only reason that I gave them four stars instead of five is that they are made in China; I really wish they were made in the United States. I must warn you though; your dog may become addicted--just like mine :)

Summary: AMAZING Raw Honey!!!
Text:  This is the best raw honey. I won't repeat what the other two reviewers said, because they summed it up perfectly! But, I will tell you that you can actually taste flowers (as orange blossom honey has a citrus flavor, this has a floral taste). It's heavenly. I've been using it as "cough medicine" since I caught my son's cold and I've never used anything more effective. I will continue to eat a couple of tablespoons of this a day to get all of the minerals, antioxidants, etc. It really is the BEST raw honey I've ever purchased, and I'm shocked I bought it from a health food store and not a local farmer's market! You will NOT be disappointed!!

Summary: Food of the Gods
Text:  Attiki honey has an excellent sweet natural flavor, is very thick, and quite possibly is the stickiest substance known to man. I would like to try some baklava made with this honey. After tasting this honey, I suspect some US honey suppliers are artificially sweetening their product. Attiki is sweet without being over-powering. Pricier than your standard supermarket honey, but well worth it. Recommended.

Summary: Best Green Tea
Text:  This is my favorite Green tea! I have 3 or 4 cups a day. The orange favor is great. You can actually smell the oranges when sniffing the tea bag and it is far fresher than your standard teas like Lipton. Besides the great taste, it has 70% more anti-oxidants than your typical Green tea. Also I should mention I have been drinking this tea as part of my workout and diet regime and have lost 25 pounds! Here is an article on how green tea helps with weight loss: http://www.benefitsofgreentea.info/2007/powerful-super-green-tea-diet.php.

Summary: Great tasting but not evenly distributed
Text:  As I had gotten older, my taste for sweets has dimished.<br />I now find most American made candy to be too sweet.<br />Jolly Ranch, which was one of my favorites from my Jr. high days, are now a bit too sweet.<br />I found these to be at the right level of sweetness.<br />I think some people complain about the taste is because they prefer the artificial sweetness found in most candy.  Nothing wrong with that (except for the health thing. :D).<br /><br />The one minor complaint I have with the 5-pound bag is the flavor distribution.<br />As several people had already mentioned, they are not distributed evenly.<br />Unlike one of the commentor, I don't believe the "to get rid of their overstock.".<br />My uneven distribution is different than other's.<br />(20%) Wet-face Watermelon<br />(20%) Pomegranate Pucker<br />(18%) Googly Grape<br />(10%) Tooberry Blueberry<br />(12%) Tart Sour Apple<br />(12%) Mango Tango<br />(6%) Very Very Cherry<br />(2%) Strawberry Smash<br /><br />Not a big deal to me because I like all of them, but my kids are more picky.<br /><br />[soapbox] Although these are organic candy, they are still candy, which are bad for your teeth.  Please watch your (and your children's) intake of these delicious lollipops. [/soapbox] :D

Summary: A Life Saver
Text:  These have been a real life saver for me. I am in my first trimester of pregnancy and when I start to feel sick I eat one the these rice cakes. Within a couple of minutes I feel back to my old self again. I love the flavor of these rice cakes, it's just enough so that you actually want to eat them, but not too strong to upset my stomach. I just wish I had thought to order more before I was down to my last rice cake, but thanks to Amazon Prime I'm having them sent overnight delivery, yes, they are that good.
